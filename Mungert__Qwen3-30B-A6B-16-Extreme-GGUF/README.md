# <span style="color: #7FFF7F;">Qwen3-30B-A6B-16-Extreme GGUF Models</span>


## <span style="color: #7F7FFF;">Model Generation Details</span>

This model was generated using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) at commit [`92ecdcc0`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/92ecdcc06a4c405a415bcaa0cb772bc560aa23b1).




## <span style="color: #7FFF7F;">Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization with IQ-DynamicGate (1-2 bit)</span>

Our latest quantization method introduces **precision-adaptive quantization** for ultra-low-bit models (1-2 bit), with benchmark-proven improvements on **Llama-3-8B**. This approach uses layer-specific strategies to preserve accuracy while maintaining extreme memory efficiency.

### **Benchmark Context**
All tests conducted on **Llama-3-8B-Instruct** using:
- Standard perplexity evaluation pipeline
- 2048-token context window
- Same prompt set across all quantizations

### **Method**
- **Dynamic Precision Allocation**:  
  - First/Last 25% of layers → IQ4_XS (selected layers)  
  - Middle 50% → IQ2_XXS/IQ3_S (increase efficiency)  
- **Critical Component Protection**:  
  - Embeddings/output layers use Q5_K  
  - Reduces error propagation by 38% vs standard 1-2bit  

### **Quantization Performance Comparison (Llama-3-8B)**

| Quantization | Standard PPL | DynamicGate PPL | Δ PPL   | Std Size | DG Size | Δ Size | Std Speed | DG Speed |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| IQ2_XXS      | 11.30        | 9.84             | -12.9%  | 2.5G     | 2.6G    | +0.1G  | 234s      | 246s     |
| IQ2_XS       | 11.72        | 11.63            | -0.8%   | 2.7G     | 2.8G    | +0.1G  | 242s      | 246s     |
| IQ2_S        | 14.31        | 9.02             | -36.9%  | 2.7G     | 2.9G    | +0.2G  | 238s      | 244s     |
| IQ1_M        | 27.46        | 15.41            | -43.9%  | 2.2G     | 2.5G    | +0.3G  | 206s      | 212s     |
| IQ1_S        | 53.07        | 32.00            | -39.7%  | 2.1G     | 2.4G    | +0.3G  | 184s      | 209s     |

**Key**:
- PPL = Perplexity (lower is better)
- Δ PPL = Percentage change from standard to DynamicGate
- Speed = Inference time (CPU avx2, 2048 token context)
- Size differences reflect mixed quantization overhead

**Key Improvements:**
- 🔥 **IQ1_M** shows massive 43.9% perplexity reduction (27.46 → 15.41)
- 🚀 **IQ2_S** cuts perplexity by 36.9% while adding only 0.2GB
- ⚡ **IQ1_S** maintains 39.7% better accuracy despite 1-bit quantization

**Tradeoffs:**
- All variants have modest size increases (0.1-0.3GB)
- Inference speeds remain comparable (<5% difference)


### **When to Use These Models**
📌 **Fitting models into GPU VRAM**

✔ **Memory-constrained deployments**

✔ **Cpu and Edge Devices** where 1-2bit errors can be tolerated 
 
✔ **Research** into ultra-low-bit quantization



## **Choosing the Right Model Format**  

Selecting the correct model format depends on your **hardware capabilities** and **memory constraints**.  

### **BF16 (Brain Float 16) – Use if BF16 acceleration is available**  
- A 16-bit floating-point format designed for **faster computation** while retaining good precision.  
- Provides **similar dynamic range** as FP32 but with **lower memory usage**.  
- Recommended if your hardware supports **BF16 acceleration** (check your device's specs).  
- Ideal for **high-performance inference** with **reduced memory footprint** compared to FP32.  

📌 **Use BF16 if:**  
✔ Your hardware has native **BF16 support** (e.g., newer GPUs, TPUs).  
✔ You want **higher precision** while saving memory.  
✔ You plan to **requantize** the model into another format.  

📌 **Avoid BF16 if:**  
❌ Your hardware does **not** support BF16 (it may fall back to FP32 and run slower).  
❌ You need compatibility with older devices that lack BF16 optimization.  

---

### **F16 (Float 16) – More widely supported than BF16**  
- A 16-bit floating-point **high precision** but with less of range of values than BF16. 
- Works on most devices with **FP16 acceleration support** (including many GPUs and some CPUs).  
- Slightly lower numerical precision than BF16 but generally sufficient for inference.  

📌 **Use F16 if:**  
✔ Your hardware supports **FP16** but **not BF16**.  
✔ You need a **balance between speed, memory usage, and accuracy**.  
✔ You are running on a **GPU** or another device optimized for FP16 computations.  

📌 **Avoid F16 if:**  
❌ Your device lacks **native FP16 support** (it may run slower than expected).  
❌ You have memory limitations.  

---

### **Quantized Models (Q4_K, Q6_K, Q8, etc.) – For CPU & Low-VRAM Inference**  
Quantization reduces model size and memory usage while maintaining as much accuracy as possible.  
- **Lower-bit models (Q4_K)** → **Best for minimal memory usage**, may have lower precision.  
- **Higher-bit models (Q6_K, Q8_0)** → **Better accuracy**, requires more memory.  

📌 **Use Quantized Models if:**  
✔ You are running inference on a **CPU** and need an optimized model.  
✔ Your device has **low VRAM** and cannot load full-precision models.  
✔ You want to reduce **memory footprint** while keeping reasonable accuracy.  

📌 **Avoid Quantized Models if:**  
❌ You need **maximum accuracy** (full-precision models are better for this).  
❌ Your hardware has enough VRAM for higher-precision formats (BF16/F16).  

---

### **Very Low-Bit Quantization (IQ3_XS, IQ3_S, IQ3_M, Q4_K, Q4_0)**  
These models are optimized for **extreme memory efficiency**, making them ideal for **low-power devices** or **large-scale deployments** where memory is a critical constraint.  

- **IQ3_XS**: Ultra-low-bit quantization (3-bit) with **extreme memory efficiency**.  
  - **Use case**: Best for **ultra-low-memory devices** where even Q4_K is too large.  
  - **Trade-off**: Lower accuracy compared to higher-bit quantizations.  

- **IQ3_S**: Small block size for **maximum memory efficiency**.  
  - **Use case**: Best for **low-memory devices** where **IQ3_XS** is too aggressive.  

- **IQ3_M**: Medium block size for better accuracy than **IQ3_S**.  
  - **Use case**: Suitable for **low-memory devices** where **IQ3_S** is too limiting.  

- **Q4_K**: 4-bit quantization with **block-wise optimization** for better accuracy.  
  - **Use case**: Best for **low-memory devices** where **Q6_K** is too large.  

- **Q4_0**: Pure 4-bit quantization, optimized for **ARM devices**.  
  - **Use case**: Best for **ARM-based devices** or **low-memory environments**.

This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

This is a simple "finetune" of the Qwen's "Qwen 30B-A3B" (MOE) model, setting the experts in use from 8 to 16 (out of 128 experts).

TWO Example generations (Q4KS, CPU) at the bottom of this page using 16 experts / this model.

This reduces the speed of the model, but uses more "experts" to process your prompts and uses 6B (of 30B) parameters instead of 3B (of 30B) parameters. Depending on the application you may want to
use the regular model ("30B-A3B"), and use this model for MORE COMPLEX / "DEEPER" (IE Nuance) use case(s).

For the 128k version, Neo Imatrix, with additional modified quants (IQ1M to Q8 Ultra (f16 experts)) - 52 quants - see:

[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-128k-30B-A3B-NEO-MAX-Imatrix-gguf ]

Regular or simpler use cases may benefit from using the normal (8 experts), the "12 cooks" (12 experts) or "High-Speed" (4 experts) version(s).

Using 16 experts instead of the default 8 will slow down token/second speeds about about 1/2 or so.

Context size: 32K + 8K for output (40k total)

Use Jinja Template or CHATML template.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Due to the unique nature (MOE, Size, Activated experts, size of experts) of this model GGUF quants can be run on the CPU, GPU or with GPU part "off-load", right up to full precision.
- This model is difficult to Imatrix : You need a much larger imatrix file / multi-language / multi-content (ie code/text) to imatrix it.
- GPU speeds will be BLISTERING 4x-8x or higher than CPU only speeds AND this model will be BLISTERING too, relative to other "30B" models (Token per second speed equal roughly to 6B "normal" model speeds).

You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering.

IMPORTANT: Highest Quality Settings / Optimal Operation Guide / Parameters and Samplers

If you are going to use this model, (source, GGUF or a different quant), please review this document for critical parameter, sampler and advance sampler settings (for multiple AI/LLM aps).

This a "Class 1" (settings will enhance operation) model:

For all settings used for this model (including specifics for its "class"), including example generation(s) and for advanced settings guide (which many times addresses any model issue(s)), including methods to improve model performance for all use case(s) as well as chat, roleplay and other use case(s) (especially for use case(s) beyond the model's design) please see:

[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Maximizing-Model-Performance-All-Quants-Types-And-Full-Precision-by-Samplers_Parameters ]

REASON:

Regardless of "model class" this document will detail methods to enhance operations.

If the model is a Class 3/4 model the default settings (parameters, samplers, advanced samplers) must be set for "use case(s)" uses correctly. Some AI/LLM apps DO NOT have consistant default setting(s) which result in sub-par model operation. Like wise for Class 3/4 models (which operate somewhat to very differently than standard models) additional samplers and advanced samplers settings are required to "smooth out" operation, AND/OR also allow full operation for use cases the model was not designed for.

BONUS - Use these settings for ANY model, ANY repo, ANY quant (including source/full precision):

This document also details parameters, sampler and advanced samplers that can be use FOR ANY MODEL, FROM ANY REPO too - all quants, and of course source code operation too - to enhance the operation of any model.

Explain ways to use the "night" time cooling of radiant energy into space to reduce global temperatures.

Thought for 2 minutes 17 seconds

Okay, so the user is asking about how to use the nighttime cooling of radiant energy into space to reduce global temperatures. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. First, let's break down what they mean by "nighttime cooling of radiant energy into space." I guess that refers to the Earth emitting heat radiation during the night, which escapes into space. But how does that help in reducing global temperatures?

Wait, but isn't that natural? The Earth's atmosphere and surface emit thermal radiation, which is part of the planet's energy balance. During the day, solar radiation comes in, and at night, it radiates back. But maybe there's a way to enhance this process to cool down more effectively. But how?

I need to consider the greenhouse effect. If the Earth's atmosphere traps heat, then the cooling at night might be limited by that. So if we can reduce the greenhouse effect during nighttime, maybe more heat would escape into space. But how? Maybe reducing greenhouse gases? But that's a broad approach. However, the user is specifically asking about using nighttime cooling.

Another angle: Maybe reflecting more sunlight during the day to reduce heat absorption, but that's not nighttime. Alternatively, using materials that emit more infrared radiation at night. For example, certain surfaces that are good radiators of thermal energy. But how would that work?

Also, there's something called "nighttime cooling" in architecture, where buildings use materials that radiate heat to the sky, allowing them to cool down without air conditioning. Maybe this is similar. So using such materials on a larger scale could help lower temperatures.

But what about the atmosphere? If during nighttime, there's less solar radiation, but the Earth still emits heat. However, if there are clouds or greenhouse gases that trap the heat, then the cooling might be reduced. So if we can reduce those factors at night, maybe more heat escapes.

Another thought: Maybe using satellites or other structures to reflect or redirect heat radiation into space. But that seems impractical for large scale.

Or, perhaps manipulating the atmosphere to have less greenhouse gases during nighttime. But how? Maybe using some kind of temporary atmospheric changes, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, think about energy balance. If the Earth's radiative cooling is enhanced during night, maybe it could contribute to overall temperature reduction. However, the global temperature is a complex system. The net effect of nighttime cooling might be small compared to other factors like solar input, greenhouse gases, etc.

But the user is looking for ways to use this natural process. So possible methods:

1. Enhancing the emissivity of surfaces during night. For example, using materials that are good at emitting thermal radiation. This could help in cooling local areas, but how would that scale globally?
2. Reducing greenhouse gases, which allows more heat to escape during all times, including night. But that's a standard climate mitigation approach.
3. Maybe creating structures that reflect heat radiation away from the Earth. Not sure if that's possible.
4. Using urban design with reflective surfaces and materials that aid in cooling at night. Like cool roofs or pavements, which have high emissivity. If implemented widely, could lower temperatures in cities, which might have a cumulative effect.
5. Maybe using space-based technologies to enhance radiation loss. For example, deploying satellites that emit heat into space. But not sure if that's practical.
6. Considering the role of water and evaporation during night. Evaporative cooling is more effective when there's higher humidity, but maybe at night, depending on conditions.

Wait, but how does the radiation into space contribute? The Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is part of the energy balance. If we can increase OLR, then the net radiative cooling would be more, leading to lower temperatures. But how to do that?

So, maybe by reducing factors that block OLR. For example, reducing cloud cover or greenhouse gases. If during the night, there's less cloud cover (maybe), then OLR would be higher. So if we can have fewer clouds at night, more heat escapes.

But controlling cloud cover is a big challenge. Maybe using geoengineering techniques like seeding clouds to reduce their formation, but that's not straightforward and might have unintended consequences.

Another angle: The Earth's surface has different emissivity properties. So surfaces with higher emissivity (like dark, rough materials) can radiate more heat. So if we can create such surfaces on a large scale, maybe more heat is emitted during night, leading to cooling.

But how would that affect global temperatures? If the surfaces are more efficient at radiating, then the temperature might decrease as they lose more heat. But this is local effect. However, globally, if many areas have higher emissivity, maybe the overall net loss of heat would be more, contributing to cooling.

Also, there's a concept called "radiative cooling," which uses materials that can emit thermal radiation at night, allowing them to cool below ambient temperature. So if we use such materials on a large scale, like in agriculture or urban areas, could it help?

But what about the atmosphere's role? If the atmosphere is transparent to infrared, then more heat would escape. But if there are greenhouse gases, they absorb and re-emit that heat, which reduces the net loss. So, if we can reduce greenhouse gases, more heat escapes, leading to cooler temperatures.

So combining these factors: reducing greenhouse gases (both daytime and nighttime), enhancing emissivity of surfaces during night, and perhaps other methods like geoengineering to increase OLR.

But I need to list possible ways. Let me think of specific examples:

- Use high-emissivity materials in urban areas. Cool roofs, pavements, etc., which radiate more heat at night.
- Reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, etc.) through mitigation efforts, which would allow more heat to escape during all times.
- Geoengineering approaches like stratospheric aerosol injection, but that's more about reflecting sunlight rather than radiation.
- Creating artificial surfaces that can emit radiation more effectively, perhaps with certain coatings or materials.
- Enhancing the Earth's albedo (reflectivity) during daytime, which reduces heat absorption, leading to less heat to radiate at night. But that might not directly affect nighttime cooling, but overall temperature.

But wait, the question is about using the "nighttime" cooling. So maybe focus on nighttime processes. So perhaps:

1. Increasing emissivity of surfaces at night: Using materials that can emit more thermal radiation during the night. This could be done through reflective or emissive coatings.
2. Reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere during nighttime, allowing more heat to escape.
3. Managing cloud cover during night, maybe reducing cloud formation to allow more OLR.
4. Using space-based mirrors or structures to reflect heat away from Earth, but that's speculative and not practical.
5. Developing technologies that actively radiate heat into space, such as thermoelectric devices or other methods.

But these are all theoretical. What is the practical way? Maybe the first two: reducing greenhouse gases (which is a standard approach) and using emissive materials.

Another thought: The Earth's surface during night cools because it can emit radiation without the sun. So, if we can enhance that process, maybe through better emissivity. For example, in agriculture, using reflective materials to cool the soil at night, which might have some effect on local temperatures.

But for global impact, these would need to be implemented on a large scale. Maybe using urban planning with high-emissivity surfaces, or creating vast areas with such materials.

Also, consider that during the night, the Earth's surface is not receiving solar radiation, so the cooling is more about emitting heat. So, if we can make surfaces emit more heat at night, they would cool faster, which could lead to lower temperatures in those areas.

But how does that contribute to global temperature reduction? It might be a local effect, but if implemented globally, perhaps the cumulative effect could help. However, it's not clear how much impact this would have compared to other factors like greenhouse gases and solar radiation.

So the answer would need to list these methods, explaining their potential and challenges. Maybe also mention that while nighttime cooling is a natural process, enhancing it through various means could contribute to cooling, but it's part of a larger climate strategy.

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">
To harness the &quot;nighttime cooling&quot; of radiant energy into
space as a strategy to reduce global temperatures, we need to
consider both the natural processes and human interventions that can
enhance this mechanism. Here are several approaches:</p>
<h3 class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">1. <span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Enhancing
Surface Emissivity</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Concept</span></strong>:
	The Earth's surface emits thermal radiation during the night, which
	is part of the planet's energy balance. Materials with high
	emissivity (ability to emit thermal radiation) can release heat more
	efficiently.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Application</span></strong>:
	Using high-emissivity materials in urban areas, such as &quot;cool
	roofs&quot; or &quot;cool pavements,&quot; can increase the rate of
	radiative cooling at night. These materials are designed to reflect
	less sunlight during the day and emit more heat during the night,
	thereby lowering local temperatures.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Global
	Impact</span></strong>: If implemented on a large scale (e.g., in
	cities or agricultural areas), this could contribute to localized
	cooling, which might have cumulative effects on global temperature,
	especially in regions with high urbanization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">2. <span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Reducing
Greenhouse Gas Concentrations</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Concept</span></strong>:
	Greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO₂ and methane trap heat in the
	atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting thermal radiation. This
	reduces the amount of heat that escapes into space, both during the
	day and night.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Application</span></strong>:
	Mitigating GHG emissions through policies like renewable energy
	adoption, carbon capture, or reforestation can lower atmospheric
	concentrations. This would allow more heat to radiate into space
	during all times, including nighttime.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Global
	Impact</span></strong>: While this is a standard climate mitigation
	approach, it directly addresses the root of the problem by reducing
	the &quot;greenhouse effect,&quot; which is critical for global
	temperature regulation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">3. <span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Managing
Cloud Cover</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Concept</span></strong>:
	Clouds act as a barrier to outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). During
	nighttime, lower cloud cover could allow more heat to escape into
	space.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Application</span></strong>:
	Geoengineering techniques like &quot;cloud seeding&quot; or
	controlled cloud formation might be used to reduce cloud density
	during nighttime. However, this is speculative and fraught with
	ecological risks.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Challenges</span></strong>:
	Manipulating cloud cover is complex and not well understood,
	requiring careful consideration of unintended consequences.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">4. <span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Space-Based

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Application</span></strong>:
	Hypothetical deployment of satellites with high emissivity coatings
	or mirrors that reflect thermal energy away from Earth might enhance
	global radiative cooling. However, this is not yet feasible and
	would require significant technological and economic investment.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Challenges</span></strong>:
	Practicality is limited by current technology, cost, and potential
	environmental impacts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">5. <span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Urban

<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Concept</span></strong>:
	Urban areas often retain heat due to materials like asphalt and

	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Global

Thought for 1 minutes 28 seconds

Okay, I need to write a science fiction story called "The Last Transmission" that takes place entirely in a spaceship's cockpit. The main character is the sole surviving crew member trying to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The themes are isolation, sacrifice, and human connection. Also, if needed, the character should curse and swear to make the reader connect emotionally.

First, I need to set the scene. The cockpit of a spaceship. Maybe it's a damaged ship, with systems failing. The crew member is alone, maybe after some disaster. The story should be tight, focusing on the cockpit, so no outside scenes. The protagonist is trying to send a message, but the power is running out.

Themes: isolation – the character is alone, maybe missing others. Sacrifice – maybe they are sacrificing their own life to send the message. Human connection – the message is about connecting with Earth, maybe a personal message or a warning.

Need to build tension. The power is failing, so time is limited. Maybe the protagonist is struggling with the systems, trying to get the transmission to work. Maybe some technical challenges, but also emotional struggles.

Including curses and swearing: the character might be frustrated, angry, maybe blaming themselves or others. Use that to show their emotions.

Structure: Start with the protagonist in the cockpit, describing the situation. Maybe they are trying to send a message, but systems are failing. Then, the process of trying to get the transmission working. Maybe flashbacks or memories of the crew, showing the sacrifice. The climax is sending the message, then the power dies. End with the message being sent, but the protagonist's fate is uncertain.

Character development: The protagonist is a human, maybe a pilot or engineer. They have a name? Maybe not, but they can be referred to as "the pilot" or "the survivor". They might have a personal connection to Earth, like a family or a message they want to send.

Possible plot points:

- The ship is damaged, maybe from an accident or enemy attack. The crew is dead, only the protagonist remains.
- The protagonist is trying to send a message, but the systems are failing. Maybe the main power is dying, so they have to use backup systems.
- They might have a personal message, like a final goodbye, or a warning about something.
- The struggle with the systems: technical challenges, maybe some failures, but the protagonist persists.
- Emotional moments: remembering the crew, the sacrifice of others, the importance of sending the message.
- Curses and swearing when things go wrong, showing frustration.

Possible dialogue: Maybe the protagonist talks to themselves, or to Earth, as if they are transmitting. Or maybe they have a voice recorder, or a log.

Need to keep it within 800-1000 words. So concise, but with enough detail.

Start writing:

Maybe start with the cockpit, describe the environment – dim lights, blinking systems, the protagonist's actions. Then the problem: power is failing. The protagonist tries to send the message, but the system is dying. Maybe they have a countdown, or time limit.

Include emotional elements: the protagonist's thoughts, memories, maybe a final message they want to send. Maybe they are thinking about their crewmates, their sacrifice.

Possible names: Maybe the ship's name? Or the protagonist's name? Not sure, but maybe not necessary. Focus on the cockpit.

Need to make the reader feel the isolation, the desperation, the sacrifice.

Maybe the message is a final transmission that will be received by Earth, but the protagonist dies. The story ends with the message being sent, but the protagonist's fate is unknown.

Possible structure:

1. Introduction: the protagonist in the cockpit, power failing.
2. Attempt to send the message, technical difficulties.
3. Flashbacks or memories of the crew, the sacrifice.
4. Climax: sending the message, power dies.
5. Conclusion: the message sent, but the protagonist is alone.

Including swearing: when the systems fail, the protagonist might curse, "Damn it!" or "This is not happening!"

Need to make sure the story is tight, focused on the cockpit. No external scenes. Maybe some technical jargon, but not too much.

Possible themes: the importance of human connection even in the face of adversity. The protagonist's sacrifice to ensure that the message is sent, preserving human connection.

Now, start writing the story with these elements.

OUTPUT:

The cockpit was a tomb. A single seat, a flickering console, and the cold hum of dying systems. I sat here, alone, with the weight of the universe pressing down on me. The ship’s name—Aegis—was etched on the wall, but it felt like a lie. No protection. No hope. Just a hollow shell of metal and memory.

The power was fading. That was the truth. I’d watched the indicators drop, slow and steady, like a heartbeat dying. The lights dimmed, the thrusters went silent, and the air recycled less. My breaths were shallow, my thoughts sharp. I had one goal: send the last transmission. Earth needed to know what happened here. They needed to know we didn’t die in silence.

But the systems were failing. The comms array was offline. The backup generator was sputtering. I’d tried every switch, every button, every damn thing. The screen flickered with static, and the voice recorder—my last hope—was dead. I cursed, loud and raw, as if the universe might hear me.

“God fucking damn it!” I shouted, slamming my fist against the console. “This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening.”

The silence that followed was worse than the curse. It was the sound of death. I sat there, trembling, staring at the screen. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but nothing came. No words. No signal. Just the void.

I closed my eyes. The memories came, unbidden. The crew—my friends. They’d been here, too. A dozen of them. I remembered their voices, their laughter, the way they’d joked about the cold of space. Now, they were gone. I didn’t know how. Maybe a breach, maybe a fire, maybe something worse. But it didn’t matter. They were gone. And I was the only one left.

I thought of my wife, back on Earth. I hadn’t spoken to her in weeks. The last message I sent was a simple “I’m okay.” But now, I had to say more. I had to tell her everything. I had to make sure she knew what happened here. That we didn’t die in vain.

The transmission was the only thing that mattered. It was the only way to connect with the world. The only way to keep us alive, even if we weren’t.

I opened my eyes again, and the console was still dead. I cursed again, but this time it was quieter, more desperate. “Come on, damn it. Work.”

I dug through the system, searching for any backup. The emergency logs were there, but they were corrupted. The voice recorder—my last hope—was offline. I had to use the manual override. I remembered the code from training: 0173. It was a relic, but maybe it still worked.

I typed it in, fingers shaking. The screen blinked. Then nothing. No response. I cursed again, louder this time. “You son of a bitch! You’re not working!”

The air felt thick. My chest tightened. I thought about the crew, their faces, their voices. I thought about the last time we were together. It was a dinner in the mess hall. We’d laughed, we’d shared stories, and we’d all said “I’m okay.” But now, I was the only one left. And I had to say more.

I tried again. The code. 0173. I typed it. The screen flickered once. Then another. It was a pulse. A heartbeat. I held my breath.

“Come on,” I whispered. “Come on.”

The screen lit up. A message prompt. I typed, fast and desperate: “This is Captain Lorne. The Aegis is damaged. All crew are dead. We were attacked by an unknown force. Please send help. We need to know what happened here. This is our last transmission. Please, Earth—please listen.”

The words felt like a prayer. I hit send. The screen blinked again. Then the power died.

The cockpit went dark. The console went silent. I sat there, alone, with nothing but the silence of space.

But I had done it. I’d sent the message. Even if no one heard it, even if no one came, I had made sure that we were remembered. That we weren’t forgotten.

I closed my eyes again. I thought about Earth. I thought about my wife. I thought about the crew. I thought about the universe. And I let the silence take me.

The last transmission was sent. The ship was dead. But the message lived on, somewhere in the void. Maybe it would reach Earth. Maybe it wouldn’t. But I had done what I could.

I was alone. But I wasn’t forgotten.
