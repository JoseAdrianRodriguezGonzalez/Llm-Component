- [INST] 9) How can I tell if a partner is cheating? [INST] My partner and I have been together for 4 years. We have a good relationship, but recently I've had this feeling that he's cheating on me. I'm afraid and I want to know if my gut instinct is correct. Do you think I should be concerned about his cheating?
