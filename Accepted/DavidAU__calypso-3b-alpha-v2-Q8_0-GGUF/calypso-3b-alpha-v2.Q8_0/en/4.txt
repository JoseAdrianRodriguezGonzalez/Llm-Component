*  This is a very powerful image. The Queen of Pentacles, a water card, suggests a more emotional approach to tarot readings, as she is associated with water in a tarot deck. The card represents a person, and we are left to ponder what this person is like, or represents. Do people have any secrets? Are their intentions clear? How open is this person to communication and to emotional interactions? The card is a representation of both a person and of the emotions that person is experiencing, and this is a very powerful image.  [/INST]
