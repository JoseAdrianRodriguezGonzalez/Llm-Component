The Fire card burns within you, a divine spark igniting your will. It purifies your path, making space for new creations to emerge from the ashes of the old. Your passions, when channeled consciously, can transform you - you must decide which desires are authentic and worthy of your efforts, and which no longer serve your highest purpose. The fire of ten represents a potential for great growth - but it may also burn beyond your control, incinerating that which is not yet ripe for change. 

The tenth, or waning of a cycle, signifies a completion - and a new beginning. Where will you direct your vital force? Towards what will you channel your passion? With disciplined deliberation, your fire can be a great force for constructive change. But you must decide which actions align with your dharma.
