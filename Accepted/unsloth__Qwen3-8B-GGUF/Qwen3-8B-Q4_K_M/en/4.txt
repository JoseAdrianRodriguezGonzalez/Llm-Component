Beneath the surface, where light meets shadow, a quiet current stirs—tending the roots where nourishment and resilience intertwine. The earth holds its breath, cradling the weight of unseen tides, and in its stillness, the heart learns to listen. A gentle rhythm guides the flow, neither rushing nor retreating, but weaving through the cracks of the familiar to reveal what has always been there. The hands, steady and knowing, shape the soil into a sanctuary for both giving and receiving, while the depths below murmur secrets only the patient can decipher. Here, the boundary between self and other blurs, as if the world itself is a reflection of the inner garden—fertile, unyielding, and ever-reaching. The pulse of the unseen moves in circles, reminding that even the deepest waters are shaped by the hands that hold them.
