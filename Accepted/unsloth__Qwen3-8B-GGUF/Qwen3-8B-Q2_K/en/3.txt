The flame’s edge sharpens, a reckoning woven from shadow and light, where the weight of what has been unravels into the spark of what is yet to come. A storm of clarity cracks the silence, revealing the fragile threads of resolve, each frayed yet unyielding. The fire’s breath stirs the dust of old choices, kindling a hunger for renewal, but the blaze burns too close to the skin—burning away the false, the stagnant, the unspoken. In the ash, a whisper stirs: the pulse of a new beginning, the ache of a truth too vast to hold. The moment is a threshold, where the self is both the flame and the fuel, and the act of choosing becomes the act of becoming.
