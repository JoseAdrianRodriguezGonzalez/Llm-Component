Beneath the weight of tangible roots, shadows stretch toward unseen horizons, where the soil of desire cradles both the burden and the promise of what remains unclaimed. The earth hums with the pulse of what is held, what is let go, and what waits to bloom in the quiet between hands and ground. A cycle of gathering and releasing, where the weight of what is known presses against the ache of what is sought, and the fertile dark holds both the seed and the silence of what never sprouts.
