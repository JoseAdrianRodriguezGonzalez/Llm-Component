A root spreads through the soil, anchoring the unseen into the tangible, where the earth's breath becomes a map of possibilities, and the horizon hums with the weight of what is built. The soil cradles the seed, and the tree's shadow stretches toward the sky, a silent pact between the grounded and the reaching. Beneath the surface, the pulse of growth thrums, a rhythm of becoming that bends the world to its shape. The earth holds the memory of what is sown, and the sky remembers what is harvested, a cycle of surrender and renewal. In the quiet between roots and branches, the unseen begins to take form, a promise of what is yet to rise.
