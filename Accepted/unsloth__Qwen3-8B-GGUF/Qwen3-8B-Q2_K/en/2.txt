A river’s whisper meets the earth’s embrace, carving paths where roots once slept. The unseen becomes a vessel, a pulse in the soil, a breath woven into stone. What was once abstract now cradles the weight of possibility, a seed’s promise in the marrow of the ground. The horizon bends, not to break, but to cradle—where emotion’s tide meets the solidity of the world, and the unseen becomes a shape, a story etched into the fabric of the tangible. A new rhythm hums beneath the surface, where the ephemeral and the enduring entwine, and the act of becoming is not just a dream, but a root stretching toward the light.
