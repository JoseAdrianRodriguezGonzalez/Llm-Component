Under the veil of shifting tides, a silent current shapes the shore, where the weight of unseen depths carves the landscape of the soul. The ruler of the realm, with hands steady on the helm, navigates the labyrinth of feeling, where every ripple holds a truth yet to be named. In the quiet of the deep, where light bends and shadows linger, the heart's compass aligns with the pulse of the unseen. The path is carved not by force, but by the rhythm of the tide, where the leader's gaze holds the mirror of the abyss, and the echo of the past becomes the map of the future. Here, the boundary between self and sea dissolves, and the act of holding the line becomes the art of letting go.
