Stillness settles in the soil, where roots clench the weight of unwatered dreams. A cup lies half-buried, its rim kissed by dust, while the earth hums with the slow pulse of what is withheld. The ground holds its breath, a silent ledger of what is taken and what is left to rot. Shadows stretch long over the threshold of the tangible, where longing carves its shape into the marrow of the world. Something stirs beneath the surfaceâ€”a seed gnawing at the stone, a hand reaching through the dirt for a truth that refuses to be held. The air thickens with the scent of decay and the promise of something new, something that has always been waiting to be named.
