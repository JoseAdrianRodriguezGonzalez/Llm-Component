Embers smolder beneath the surface, a quiet storm of unspoken resolve, where the weight of accumulated burdens presses against the spine like a tide. Shadows stretch long, yet within them flickers a spark—unyielding, defiant—capable of unraveling the knots of stagnation. The air thrums with a tension between collapse and creation, as if the earth itself holds its breath, waiting for the first spark to ignite the cycle of endings and beginnings. A fire not of destruction, but of revelation, burning away the veils of what no longer serves to reveal the raw, uncharted terrain of possibility. The path ahead is not a straight line but a spiral, where every fall is a step toward redefinition, and every silence echoes with the promise of a louder, more authentic voice.
