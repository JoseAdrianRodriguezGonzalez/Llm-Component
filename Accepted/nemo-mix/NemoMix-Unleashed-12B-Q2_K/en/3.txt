In the dance of flames, shadows flicker and sway,
A fiery sword pierces the veil of night,
As embers rise, ashes fall away,
The phoenix born from the pyre's might.
In the crucible of passion's fiery glow,
The old gives way to the new's fiery birth,
As will ignites, burning bright and bold,
The divine spark kindles life's rebirth.
In the dance of flames, shadows flicker and sway,
The fiery sword pierces the veil of night,
As embers rise, ashes fall away,
The phoenix born from the pyre's might.
