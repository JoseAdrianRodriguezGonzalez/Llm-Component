Tarot is a symbolic and poetic reading tool used primarily for divination purposes. Tarot readings involve interpreting symbols depicted on cards to gain insight into personal situations, emotions, and spiritual matters. The Tarot offers valuable insights into the psychological implications of situations, providing a holistic understanding of the querent's experiences.

Tarot is not fortune telling. It does not predict future occurrences but rather reveals unconscious motivations and emotions related to a question posed by the querent. Each reader brings their own intuition and interpretation to the symbolic meanings inherent within Tarot cards. Experienced readers interpret symbols based on intuition and unconscious understanding gained through practice with Tarot decks.

Tarot readings are not meant to give life advice but offer guidance based on psychological implications derived from symbolism found within cards drawn during readings. Tarot decks consist of archetypal images that represent universal concepts applicable universally irrespective of culture or religion. Experienced readers interpret symbols according to their intuition and unconscious understanding gained through practice with Tarot decks.
