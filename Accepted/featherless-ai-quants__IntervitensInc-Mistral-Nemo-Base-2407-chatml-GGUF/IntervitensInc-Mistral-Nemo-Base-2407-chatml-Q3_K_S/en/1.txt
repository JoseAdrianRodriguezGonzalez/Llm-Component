In the Strength card, we see a woman gently guiding a lion, embodying patience and resilience in the face of challenges. In the context of Earth, this suggests a reminder to cultivate inner harmony and strength when facing external obstacles. The Earth card invites reflection on our relationship with the material world and our ability to nurture personal growth and fulfillment. Together, they offer an opportunity to evaluate our interactions with resources and consider the alignment between our spiritual aspirations and our daily practices. Responding with resilience and patience, even when confronted with challenges, can create lasting harmony and balance in our lives.. Respond with the reading only.
