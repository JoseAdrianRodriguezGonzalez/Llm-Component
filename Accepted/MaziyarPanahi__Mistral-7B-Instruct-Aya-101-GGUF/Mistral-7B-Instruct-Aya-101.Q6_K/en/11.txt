The breath of life, the whisper of the wind,
The voice of reason, the echo of the mind,
The bridge between worlds, the key to the divine,
The vessel of thought, the mirror of the soul,
The messenger of ideas, the guardian of the whole.
The air within, the air without,
The breath of life, the breath of thought.
