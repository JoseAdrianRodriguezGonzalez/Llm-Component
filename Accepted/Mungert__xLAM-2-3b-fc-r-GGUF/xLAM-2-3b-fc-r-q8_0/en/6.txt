In the heart of the fire, ten cups of abundance gather, a symphony of contentment and harmony. Each cup a vessel for the divine spark, each a testament to the will's relentless drive. The fire burns away the ashes of the past, cleansing the soul for new creations. It invites us to recognize the inner strength that fuels our actions, to align our desires with a higher purpose, and to use our power consciously, fostering growth and transformation.
