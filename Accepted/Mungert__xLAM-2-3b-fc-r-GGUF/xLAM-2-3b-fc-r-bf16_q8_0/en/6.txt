In the heart of the fire, ten cups of love and abundance gather, a symphony of contentment and unity. Each cup a vessel for the divine spark, each a testament to the will that ignites the flame of life. The seeker is called to recognize the inner strength that burns within, the power to burn away the old and create anew. It invites a reflection on the authentic desires that drive actions, to align them with a higher purpose and use this power consciously and deliberately. For in the fire, the seeker can find the courage to reinvent themselves, to transform and grow, to manifest their will in the physical world.
