The Three of Cups reversed
Upon seeing this card, I am drawn into a reverie of the ephemeral nature of life. The Three of Cups, inverted, speaks to the fleeting, momentary quality of human connection and the inevitability of change. Just as the cups have been overturned, so too are our relationships and experiences transitory. The image of three empty vessels evokes a sense of the ephemeral, the intangible, the unattainable. And yet, in the reversal, there is a glimmer of hope - a reminder that the contents of a cup are not lost, but merely dispersed, waiting to be poured out anew. This card whispers of the impermanence of all things and the need to cherish each moment, for it is a rare opportunity to experience the raw beauty of the present.
