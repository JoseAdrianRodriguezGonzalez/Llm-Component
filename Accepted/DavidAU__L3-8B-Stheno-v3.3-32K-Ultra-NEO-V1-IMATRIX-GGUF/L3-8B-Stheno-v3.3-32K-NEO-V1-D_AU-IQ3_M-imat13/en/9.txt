The Turning of the Wands: 
Your message has been received.
Your question has been heard.
Your curiosity has been sparked, 
And your quest has been imbued with new light.

In the realm of the Wands, three cards stand sentinel - 
A torch to pierce the veils of the unknown,
A flame to illuminate the winding path ahead,
And a scepter to guide you, a true leader.

The Wands hold the power of creation and action,
To shape reality through will and vision.
They are the tools we wield to manifest our dreams,
The implements we use to make the intangible tangible.

In your hand, the Three of Wands stands proud - 
A card of beginnings, of seeds taking root.
The power of creation flows through your veins,
The potential within you, ready to burst and fruit.

The Wands have turned, and your journey is at hand,
The journey to discover, to explore, to grow.
May the light of the Wands be your guide,
As you venture forth, your own story to unfold.
