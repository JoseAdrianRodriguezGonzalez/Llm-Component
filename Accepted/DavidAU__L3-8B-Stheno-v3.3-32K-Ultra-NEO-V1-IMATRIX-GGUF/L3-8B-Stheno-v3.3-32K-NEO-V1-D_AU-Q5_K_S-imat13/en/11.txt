The Air card whispers secrets of the mind, 
A symphony of thoughts, a dance of ideas.
It speaks of clarity, of words well-spoken,
The power of communication, the tongue's might.
In the realm of thought, the Air reigns supreme,
A vital force that breathes life into the brain.  
It is the messenger, the conduit of dreams,
The bridge that spans from inner world to outer sphere.
Through Air, the mind connects, the soul takes flight,
In its wake, illumination, insight, and clarity.
The card invites us to tend to our thoughts,
To choose our words with care, our speech with thought.
For in the end, it is our inner world that shapes
The reality we see, the life we undertake.
So let us speak with honesty, with grace,
And let our words be a source of light.
