The water card, a vessel of emotions,
Reflects the psyche's hidden waters.
It speaks to intuitions deep,
The depths of feelings steep.
The Queen of Pentacles, a watery throne,
Invites us to explore our own waters.
To dive beneath the surface, seek the truth, 
And discover what resides within.
The chalice offers a chance,
To taste the mysteries, experience the ripples.
For the water card, the emotional journey,
Reveals our inner waters, our hidden currents.
