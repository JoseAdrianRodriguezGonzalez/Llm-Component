The Queen of Swords, an enigmatic and introspective figure, stands poised in her golden reganzen, her eyes upon the horizon. She surveys the landscape of the mind, her gaze steady yet piercing. The Earth, that great wheel of the world, turns beneath her feet. And what does Her Majesty see in the cards of destiny that she now holds? A call to the world that beckons. The siren's song, the call of a new adventure. A journey to the Self and its shadow, the depths of our own being. The Quest of the Soul is at hand, in an unassuming guise of a deck of 78 cards. The Moon's silent witness, always at the heels of our journey. What is it that we seek, when it comes to the Queen of Swords? What is the nature of our pilgrimage, in the realm of the known? The question of the Heart, the Heart's question. And in the end, where do we find the answer? Where does the Truth stand?
