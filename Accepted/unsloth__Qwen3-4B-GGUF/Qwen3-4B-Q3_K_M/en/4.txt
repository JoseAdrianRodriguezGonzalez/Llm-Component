The depths of your being hold a stillness that is both vast and quiet, where the currents of feeling move in slow, deliberate rhythms. You are in a space where the water of your inner world is not just reflected but held, shaped by the weight of what has been submerged and what is yet to rise. Here, the act of holding is not resistance but a quiet assertion of what is yours, a presence that lingers in the stillness between waves. You are both the river and the shore, where the echo of past and future meet in the soft, unbroken flow of what is held. This is a place of deepening resonance, where the water remembers your touch and the weight of your being is not a burden but a foundation. You are in the space where the unseen becomes the known, and the act of holding on is not a loss but a preparation for what is yet to come.
