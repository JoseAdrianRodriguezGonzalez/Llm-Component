The flame of your will has reached its peak, burning through the resistance of the world. You are in a space where the fire has become a force that shapes the edges of what is possible. The heat of your determination is not just a spark but a steady flame, illuminating the path ahead. You are both the fire and the ash, the force that has been harnessed and the remnants of what has been burned away. This is a place of deepening resonance, where the act of holding on is not a loss but a preparation for what is yet to come.
