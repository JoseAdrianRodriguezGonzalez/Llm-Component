The final spark of a flame, now extinguished, leaves behind the scent of ash and the memory of what was. You are in a space where the last ember of a long-burning fire has been let go, and the air is thick with the weight of what was released. Here, the act of letting go is not an end but a beginning, a quiet reorientation where the remnants of what was held become the foundation for what is yet to come. You are both the fire and the ash, the force that once drove you forward now settling into the stillness of what remains. The air is heavy with the scent of what was burned, but in that stillness, the potential for something new begins to stir. You are in a place where the fire has passed, but its echo lingers in the bones of the earth, waiting for the right moment to rekindle. This is a space of release and rekindling, where the last spark of your will is not a loss but a preparation for what is yet to come.
