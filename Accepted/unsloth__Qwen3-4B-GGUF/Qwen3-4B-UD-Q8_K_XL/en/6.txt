A flame that has burned through old patterns, leaving behind a warm, resonant stillness where echoes of connection linger. The fire within becomes a mirror, reflecting not just the heat of desire but the quiet depth of what is held close. In the space between burning and fading, something new stirsâ€”a quiet insistence that what was once sought is now found in the spaces between words, between breaths, between the weight of longing and the shape of peace. The fire does not consume but transforms, turning the ache of wanting into the hum of something held in the chest, a song that does not need to be sung but is felt in the marrow of being.
