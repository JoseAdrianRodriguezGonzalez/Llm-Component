A foundation of roots, where the weight of what has been built presses into the earth, shaping the landscape with quiet, unshakable presence. The soil holds the shape of what has been gathered, not through force, but through the slow, steady shaping of what has always been there. Roots stretch not toward the sky, but toward the depths of what has been earned, a silent resistance to the shift that must come. The air hums with the echo of a structure that has been laid, a stillness that does not belong to the earth but to the things it cannot hold. Here, the material and the unseen meet, and the ground, ever patient, offers its silence as a vessel for the things that cannot be rushed. The world is not broken; it is being held, one quiet, unshaken truth at a time.
