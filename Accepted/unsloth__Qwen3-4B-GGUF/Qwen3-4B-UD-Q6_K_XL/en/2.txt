A quiet current rises from the soil, weaving through roots and stone, carrying the weight of unseen waters into the shape of something solid. The earth hums with the memory of seeds once planted, now blooming in ways that defy the horizon. A new kind of stillness settles where the sky and ground meet, a place where the ache of longing meets the touch of what is real. Here, the air holds the scent of growth, and the ground remembers how to cradle both the fragile and the enduring. A balance shifts, not in force, but in the quiet understanding that what is nurtured in the dark becomes a part of the world in its own time.
