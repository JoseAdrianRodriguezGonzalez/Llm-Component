Beneath the surface, where currents weave through the unseen, a force stirsâ€”rooted yet fluid, steady yet shifting. It is the weight of deep waters, where the silent pulse of the soul meets the shore of the known. Here, the tides of feeling rise and fall, carving paths through the stone of the self, revealing the hidden grooves where truth is etched. A presence, both anchor and wave, holds the balance between the rigid and the free, the structured and the flowing. In this space, the unseen currents of emotion shape the landscape of being, guiding the soul through the labyrinth of its own depths. The water mirrors the hidden, the unspoken, the uncharted, and in its stillness, the answer lies not in force, but in the quiet surrender to the pull of the unknown.
