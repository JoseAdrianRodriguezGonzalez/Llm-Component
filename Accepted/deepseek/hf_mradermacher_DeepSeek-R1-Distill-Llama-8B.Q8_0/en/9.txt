The earth stirs beneath your feet, a quiet rumble of potential unfurling like the first shoots of spring. Your spirit, once tethered to the ground, begins to stir, a restless wanderer yearning to break free into the unknown. This is not a time to stand still, but to move, to step into the void and trust the ground beneath you. The world is alive, a living breath that whispers opportunities in your ear, each a chance to grow, to change, to become. Balance is key here, the weight of your material world pressing against your heart, yet your spirit soars, undeterred by the weight. In this dance between the physical and the divine, you find your path, your purpose, a journey where every step is a testament to your resilience and your faith. The Three of Wands whispers of new beginnings, a call to embrace the unknown, to let your ideas take root and bloom into something tangible, something real.
