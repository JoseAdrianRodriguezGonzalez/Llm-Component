I sense the indomitable power of the Fire card, the force that is the driving force of the drive and will. This potent energy resides within, urging you to harness your inner strength and determination. In the realm of the 10 of Swords, you are called to burn away the obsolete and unaligned aspects of yourself. This is a sacred space for transformation, where your willpower and desire to manifest in the physical realm is tested and purified. The trials that arise from this sacred space will challenge you to confront and integrate the shadow, the rejected parts of yourself. The Fire invites you to consciously align your inner power with your highest purpose and authenticity. It calls you to examine the true nature and source of your motivation. Are your actions and decisions springing from a place of genuine desire and will? The 10 of Swords suggests the need to purify and transform your inner world, to own the power of your drive and will. In the crucible of this card, you are called to integrate your willpower, to shine the light of your highest purpose, and to burn away the darkness and half-remembers. The fires of the 10 of Swords are the flames of the self, awaiting your conscious alignment.
