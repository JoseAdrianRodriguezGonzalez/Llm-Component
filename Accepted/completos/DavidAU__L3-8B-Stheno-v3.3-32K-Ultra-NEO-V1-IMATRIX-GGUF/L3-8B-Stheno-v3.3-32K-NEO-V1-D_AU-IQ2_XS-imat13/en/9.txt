The Three of Wands is the first of the Major Arcana cards, and is often associated with the physical realm, as it represents the earthly, material, and physical manifestations of our ideas. In this reading, the focus is on the tangible world and the way we interact with our environment. The cards under this card are associated with the color of yellow, which is associated with the natural world and the creative impulse. Here we find a very active, dynamic approach, where ideas are made concrete and take form through our actions. The element of the 3 of Wands is the embodiment of our dreams, desires, and will, manifesting them in the world through our efforts and actions. The trinity of the 3 of Wands, the 2 of Cups, and the 3 of Wands, together, depicts a journey from the realms of the spiritual and ethereal to the physical and sensual. The 3 of Wands challenges us to understand how our inner vision and creative impulses translate into concrete reality. It highlights the importance of taking action and making progress, as the power of our intentions and creative expression lies in the physical realm.
