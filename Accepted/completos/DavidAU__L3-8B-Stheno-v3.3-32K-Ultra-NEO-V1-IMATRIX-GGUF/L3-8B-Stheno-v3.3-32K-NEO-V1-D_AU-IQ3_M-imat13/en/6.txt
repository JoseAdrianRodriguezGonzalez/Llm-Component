Fire Card in the Tarot of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life 
The Fire card bursts forth, a radiant orb of passion and will,
Illuming the realms of the psyche, a burning desire fulfilled.
Its flames dance with the drive of Prometheus's torch,
Stealing the sacred spark to ignite a higher purpose fulfilled.
One cannot possess Fire, but rather, it possesses the self.
The Kabbalistic Tree of Life stands tall, a metaphor for growth,
As the questing seeker, guided by the serpent's wise counsel to ascend.
The Fire that flows through all things, a divine current of consciousness, 
Becomes the key to self-realization, one's sacred mission, and the path of the Wise.
The initiate must claim Fire's mantle for themselves,
To become the will, the doer, the active force in the universe.
Only then, will the inner power of all creation be unleashed,
And the seeker's true nature be revealed and made manifest.
The journey of the hero, the path to actualization, 
Is fueled by the eternal flame of the Fire card's sacred fire.
