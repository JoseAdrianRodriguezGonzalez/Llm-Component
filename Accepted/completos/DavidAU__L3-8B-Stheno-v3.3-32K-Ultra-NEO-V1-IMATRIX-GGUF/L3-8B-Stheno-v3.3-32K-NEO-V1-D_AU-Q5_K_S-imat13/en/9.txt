The card's upright position indicates that this growth is positive and expansive, bringing new opportunities and abundance into the querent's life. The element of fire associated with the Wands suggests a passionate and dynamic approach to these new endeavors, fueling the querent's drive and determination. However, the card's placement in the Earth realm also reminds the querent to stay grounded and focused on the practical aspects of their pursuits. This balance between the spiritual and the physical is essential for long-term success and fulfillment. The Earth card invites the querent to reflect on how they can align their inner vision with their outer actions, ensuring that their deepest values and aspirations are reflected in their daily practices and interactions with the material world.
