In the stillness between cups, your eyes meet the horizon beyond the ordinary. The scent of damp earth rises, a reminder of hidden potential. What seeds lie unexplored within you, waiting to take root? The soil is fertile, but the gardener's hand remains inert. Dare to reach into the depths of your core and uncover the seedlings of transformation. For in this moment, the boundary between spirit and matter blurs. The four cups call forth the essence of your being, a whisper of change on the wind. Embrace the silence, and let the soil speak to you. Listen, and you shall find the key to unlocking your highest potential.
