Emotional currents rise and fall, a tide of feelings ebbing and flowing, revealing hidden truths in their depths. A whispered secret carried on the tides, at once soothing and tumultuous, inviting us to dive beneath the surface of our own hearts. Here, we find the source of our intuition, the wellspring of our empathy. As we surrender to the pull of our emotions, we unlock the wisdom that flows within. This journey is one of connection, both to our inner world and to the shared experiences that bind us to others. In the end, it is the depths of our feelings that guide us, that light our way home. Acknowledge them, and find the current that will carry you forward.
