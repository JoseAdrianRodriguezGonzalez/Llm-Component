In the heart of the fire, ten cups hold their weight, a symphony of love and unity. Each cup a vessel for the divine spark, each a reflection of the will that drives us to create, to connect, to transform. The fire burns away the old, the obsolete, the stagnant, leaving room for the new. It is a purifying force, a catalyst for change, a reminder to align our actions with our authentic desires, to channel our inner strength towards a higher purpose. The ten of cups invites us to recognize and properly channel our drive and willpower, to use our inner power consciously and deliberately, for personal growth and transformation.
