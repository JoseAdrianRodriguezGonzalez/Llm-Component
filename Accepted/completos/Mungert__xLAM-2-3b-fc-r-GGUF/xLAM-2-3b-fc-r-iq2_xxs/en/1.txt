The Earth card represents stability, solidity, and the capacity to sustain life. It invites us to reflect on our relationship with resources and how we manage them. We are called to consider the alignment between our spiritual aspirations and our daily practices. This card challenges us to evaluate our beliefs and emotions, promoting a balanced and sustainable approach that reflects our deepest values.
