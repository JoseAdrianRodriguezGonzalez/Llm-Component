In the realm of fire, where passion burns bright, the ten of swords whispers of purification. It calls us to recognize the strength within, the divine spark that drives us to create and change. This power, both fierce and transformative, can burn away what no longer serves us, allowing us to reinvent ourselves. It invites us to align our desires with a higher purpose, to use our inner strength consciously and deliberately. For in the dance of fire, we are both the creator and the creation, shaping our lives and the world around us.
