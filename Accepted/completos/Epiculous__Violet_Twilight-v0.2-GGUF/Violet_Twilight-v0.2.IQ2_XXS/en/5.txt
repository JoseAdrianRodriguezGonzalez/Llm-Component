The Queen of Swords, ruler of the earthly realm,
Her wisdom of stability and nurturing ground,
A new beginning for your material concerns,
Where ideas take shape and form,
The body's concrete existence.

Balance your practices and let them grow,
Sow seeds of aspiration and nurture,
Let your values take root,
In grounded, sustainable ways.
