The Ten of Cups
The Ten of Cups represents a powerful force of change and transformation. As the cups are emptied, something must be created anew. Perhaps there is a need to burn what is old to make room for what's new. What lies in your psyche that yearns to manifest? Allow yourself to feel the embers of your inner will. For your highest self demands transformation, not destruction. The fiery force within is your ally, not your adversary. Believe in your own power. Your desire is your compass. Let your will reshape your life. The Ten of Cups is a reminder that your strength resides within you. It is a call to purify your intentions and align your actions with your deepest, soulful desires. Trust the ways your will is guiding you.
