The Earth card summons you to stand on solid ground. Allow your feet to touch the soil, to feel the weight of your beliefs anchoring you through the material realm. Ten of Pentacles invites you to get real - to manifest the fertile seeds of your intentions into the solid flesh of your daily life. Let your values be as productive as your virtues - a healthy economy between body and spirit. May your practices yield crops of nourishment and may you reap the harvest of your sincere efforts. Now nurture your garden with your deepest held values and principles - they shall grow into your fulfilling Earthly home.
