Beneath the waves of your deepest feelings, a steady hand builds bridges between the seen and the unseen. The foundations of your world are not shaken by the tides, but shaped by them, like sand sculpted by the rhythm of the sea. A crown of authority rests not upon commands, but upon the understanding that true power flows from the ability to navigate the currents of emotion, to stand firm yet flow with them. The mirror of your soul reflects not just what you see, but what you feel, and in this reflection lies the key to both your strength and your vulnerability. The water rises not to drown, but to reveal, and what you find in its depths is as much a part of you as the solid peak it overlooks.
