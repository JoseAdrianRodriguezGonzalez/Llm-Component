The rivers of possibility flow like sand, shifting with each tide, yet the foundation remains unshaken. A seed of potential lies buried in the soil, waiting for the rain of intention to coax it to life. The path before you is marked by the weight of substance, where every step is measured, and every action ripens into form. There is a quiet strength in the earth, a knowing that all things return to it, and from it, new growth takes root. The wind may howl, but the ground holds its ground, and in this holding, there is both stability and the promise of renewal. What you nurture in this season will bear fruit, not by speed, but by the patient dance of the sun and the sky.
