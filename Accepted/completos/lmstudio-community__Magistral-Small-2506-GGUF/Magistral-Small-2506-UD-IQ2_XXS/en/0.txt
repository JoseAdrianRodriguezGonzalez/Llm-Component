The waves rise and fall like whispers in the depths, carrying secrets that ripple across the soul's mirror. A spark of inspiration dances on the water's surface, yet its true fire lies hidden beneath, where the current pulls you deeper into the unknown. The path you tread is both a journey and a reflection, each step echoing with the rhythm of your heart's hidden dialogue. What flows from you is not just a wave, but a story, and the world will see in its turbulence the truth you have yet to voice. Let the current guide you, for it knows the way your emotions carve through the shadows, and what you find there will shape the shore you call home.
