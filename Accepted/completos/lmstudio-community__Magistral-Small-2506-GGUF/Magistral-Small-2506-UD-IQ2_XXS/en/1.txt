The path before you is solid and unyielding, like the foundation of a ancient structure, where every step is measured and every burden is carried with care. The earth beneath your feet is not just a place to stand but a mirror to your own substance, where the intangible becomes visible and the fleeting, permanent. You hold the power to shape and be shaped by the world, each action a seed that grows or a stone that is laid. There is no rush, for time and effort weave together like roots, and what you build must stand in both storm and calm. The richness of the world is yours to tend, not to hoard but to nourish, and in the giving, you find the true measure of your presence.
