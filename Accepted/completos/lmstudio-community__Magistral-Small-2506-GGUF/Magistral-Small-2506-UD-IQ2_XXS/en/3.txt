The blade glows with the heat of a thousand suns, a sentinel in the wildness of the storm. It stands not to wound, but to bear the weight of truth—naked, unyielding, a testament to the cost of vision. The wind howls through the emptiness, whispering of battles fought not for glory, but for the quiet courage of standing when all else crumbles. Shadows stretch long, but the fire within burns without fear, a spark that refuses to be extinguished by the gale. This is the quiet before the dawn, where the soul knows the price of will and the sacredness of endurance. The path lies bare before you, not leading, but revealing—the ten swords not as obstacles, but as mirrors, each reflection a whisper of the strength you carry.
