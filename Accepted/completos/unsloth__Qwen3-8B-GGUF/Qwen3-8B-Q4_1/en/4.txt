A tide of quiet abundance flows beneath the surface, where roots grip the mud and secrets bloom in the dark. The mirror of stillness holds the weight of unspoken truths, each ripple a whisper of what lies buried. Soft hands cradle the current, shaping it into nourishment, yet the depths remain untamed, their pulse a reminder of the unseen forces that shape the shore. To dwell here is to let the water carve paths through stone, to trust the slow unraveling of what is hidden. The earth beneath is steady, but the surface shiftsâ€”reflecting not just the self, but the echoes of those who have come before. In this space, the boundary between giving and receiving blurs, and the heart becomes both wellspring and vessel, holding the storm and the calm in equal measure.
