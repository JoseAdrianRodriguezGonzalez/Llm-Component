Roots entwined with stone, a house built from the earth’s quiet patience, where time carves corridors of memory into the foundation. A tree sways with the weight of generations, its branches cradling the sky while its roots drink from the unseen. The soil hums with the rhythm of what is sown and reaped, a cycle of giving and taking that binds the hands of the present to the hands of the future. Shadows stretch long over the threshold, marking the boundary between what is held and what is left to the wind. The earth does not speak, but it remembers—the weight of a stone, the warmth of a hearth, the silence between harvests. In the marrow of the ground, something stirs: a seed waiting for the right hand to cradle it, a promise buried beneath the frost, a legacy etched into the grain of the world.
