A flame dances on the surface of still water, its flicker mirroring the unseen depths below. Whispers of the tide hum through the air, carrying fragments of longing and unspoken truths. The current pulls toward the unknown, a silent invitation to surrender to the rhythm of what stirs beneath. Shadows ripple, revealing the contours of a heart both restless and tender, where fire and fluidity entwine. A spark, small yet insistent, seeks to kindle the dark, while the depths hold their breath, waiting for the next wave to carry forward the weight of what has been buried. The horizon blurs between what is seen and what is felt, a bridge of mist where the soulâ€™s quiet currents meet the storm of becoming.
