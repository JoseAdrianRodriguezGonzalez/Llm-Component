A ruler’s shadow stretches over a still pond, its surface mirroring the sky’s unrest. Beneath the surface, currents whisper secrets older than stone, weaving through the cracks of a dam built from silence. The weight of authority hums in the bones, a steady pulse beneath the tide’s pull, yet the water refuses to be tamed—its depths hold the shape of forgotten dreams, the echo of a voice lost to time. Here, the boundary between control and surrender blurs, as if the earth itself holds its breath, waiting for the next ripple to reveal the truth hidden in the hollows of the shore.
