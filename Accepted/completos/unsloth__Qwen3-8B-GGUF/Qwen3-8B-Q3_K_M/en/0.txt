A ripple stirs in the stillness of a mirrored pool, where the sky’s breath meets the water’s edge. A flame flickers at the shore, its light refracted into hues of forgotten dreams and unspoken truths. The current carries whispers of a path not yet walked, its flow both wild and deliberate, carving channels through the unseen. Shadows dance beneath the surface, revealing fragments of a story half-told, while the air hums with the weight of a question unanswered. The seeker’s reflection is not fixed but shifting, a mosaic of longing and clarity, where every drop holds the echo of a deeper current. The horizon blurs between the known and the unknown, a threshold where the heart’s compass tilts toward the unseen, and the soul’s map is rewritten by the tide.
