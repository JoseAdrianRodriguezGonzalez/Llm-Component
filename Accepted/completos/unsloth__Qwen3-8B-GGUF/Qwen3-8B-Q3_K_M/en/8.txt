The weight of the harvest rests in hands that shape the earth, where stone and soil conspire to cradle the visible fruit of labor. Roots stretch deep, anchoring the ephemeral into permanence, while the air hums with the quiet pulse of what has been built and what remains to be passed. A tapestry of threads—some frayed, some woven—spills from the loom of time, each knot a promise, each thread a breath held between the seen and the unseen. The horizon bends where the sky meets the land, and in that meeting, the silent language of abundance speaks: not in words, but in the way the earth remembers how to grow, how to hold, how to give back what was once taken.
