A blade of frost etches the earth’s spine, carving silence into the marrow of the world. The ground hums with the weight of unspoken truths, where the sharp edge of vision meets the weight of what is made. Roots press against the skin of the earth, seeking the pulse beneath the soil, while the sky’s breath fogs the horizon. Here, the tangible becomes a mirror—crystalline, unyielding, yet cradling the seeds of what is yet to bloom. The earth holds the shape of what is not yet named, and the sharpness of the unseen cuts through the veil of what is known, leaving behind a trail of shadow and light, where the material and the imagined entwine in the quiet act of becoming.
