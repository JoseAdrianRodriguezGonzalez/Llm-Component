A quiet current carries the weight of unseen roots, where the surface glows with the pulse of hidden depths. The tide holds its breath, cradling the weight of what lies beneath, a silent promise of what is yet to rise. In the stillness, the heart's map unfoldsâ€”where the flow of feeling meets the anchor of purpose, and the soul's quiet strength becomes a bridge between the known and the unknown.
