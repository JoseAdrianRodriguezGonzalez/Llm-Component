A breath hums through the hollows of thought, where silence and speech entwine like threads in a tapestry of light. The mind, a vessel of shifting winds, carries whispers of the unseen, shaping the world with the weight of unspoken words. In the spaces between, clarity bloomsâ€”a fragile balance between what is said and what remains unvoiced. The air hums, a melody of thresholds, where the self meets the vastness, and the weight of truth rests in the pause between breaths. Shadows flicker, but the light persists, a quiet promise that even the most fragile thoughts can anchor the soul to the sky.
