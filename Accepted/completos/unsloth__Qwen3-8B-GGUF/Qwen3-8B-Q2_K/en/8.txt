A quiet hum beneath the surface, where roots intertwine with the sky, holding the weight of time in a silent pact. The earth breathes through its bones, cradling the echoes of what was built and what remains. A lattice of stone and shadow, where the past is not buried but woven into the present, each layer a whisper of what came before. The soil remembers the hands that shaped it, the hands that now cradle its secrets. A balance of what is held and what is let go, where the weight of legacy becomes a bridge to what is yet to grow. The earth does not speak, but it listensâ€”absorbing the pulse of what is planted, what is nurtured, what is left to rest. In the quiet between seasons, the foundation hums, a song of what is rooted and what is rising.
