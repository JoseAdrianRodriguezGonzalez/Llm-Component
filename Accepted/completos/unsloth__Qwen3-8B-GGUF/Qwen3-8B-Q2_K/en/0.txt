A flame dances on the surface of a vast, shifting sea, where shadows ripple and light bends. The currents whisper secrets, their rhythm a pulse of longing and surrender. Beneath the waves, something stirs—ancient, unspoken, a truth that hums in the hollows of the heart. The tide pulls, not with force, but with the quiet gravity of a memory long buried. A path emerges, not carved but traced by the weight of what is felt, not seen. The water holds its breath, then swells, a mirror of the soul’s depths, where fire and fluidity entwine in the quiet act of becoming.
