A flame once fierce now lies smothered beneath the weight of its own embers, its glow extinguished by the burden of what it has consumed. The earth holds its breath, waiting for the ash to cool, for the silence to crackle with the promise of what remains. In the hollow where the fire once roared, a seed of shadow persistsâ€”rooted in the debris of what was burned, yet whispering of the storm that once shaped the sky. The breath of the world stirs, not in defiance, but in the quiet knowing that even the deepest fall can cradle the spark of a new dawn. The weight of collapse is not an end, but the threshold where the unseen ember reignites, forging a path through the ruins. The fire does not forget; it transforms, leaving behind the charred outline of what was, and the glowing outline of what might yet rise.
