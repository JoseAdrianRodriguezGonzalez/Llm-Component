A flame dances at the edge of a hearth, its glow casting shadows that shift between warmth and embers. The air hums with a tension between what is burned and what is born, a cycle of letting go and rising. Roots dig deep into ash, seeking the spark that once ignited the world, while hands reach toward the sky, fingers curled like petals waiting to unfurl. The earth trembles with the weight of what has been held and what is yet to be claimed. A song echoes through the bones, a melody of endings and beginnings, where the heartâ€™s fire forges both the sword and the shield. The horizon blazes with a light that is neither wholly light nor dark, but a promise of something that has always been and will always return.
