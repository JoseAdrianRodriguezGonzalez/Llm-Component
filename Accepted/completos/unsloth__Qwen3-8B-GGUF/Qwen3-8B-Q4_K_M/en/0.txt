A young spirit dances at the edge of a rippling mirror, tracing the currents of the unseen. The air hums with the weight of unspoken tides, each breath a ripple in the dark. A flame flickers beneath the surface, its glow refracted through layers of shadow, revealing truths that shimmer like forgotten constellations. The path ahead is a winding river, its banks lined with whispers of the deep. To move forward is to surrender to the pull of the unknown, to let the waters carry the weight of what lingers beneath. The heart, a compass of shifting moods, guides through the fog, its pulse a rhythm of longing and release. In the stillness between waves, something stirsâ€”a seed of clarity, waiting to bloom in the light of recognition. The journey is not about control, but about becoming a vessel for the flow, allowing the depths to shape the shore.
