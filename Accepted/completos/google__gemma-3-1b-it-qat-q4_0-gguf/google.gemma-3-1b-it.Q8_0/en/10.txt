The swirling depths of this card invite you to become a vessel for the currents within. A powerful current, undeniably, pulls you towards the surface, yet it’s the shadowed pools beneath that hold the greatest truth.  A steady hand, a measured approach, is needed as you navigate this expansive space.  

The weight of experience settles upon you, a gentle pressure, demanding you acknowledge the echoes of the past.  It’s a recognition of the strength and vulnerability intertwined within your being.  

Look closely at the reflection – not of what you *should* be, but of what *is*.  Let the flow guide you, allowing the subtle shifts in hue to reveal the landscape of your heart.  A quiet understanding begins to bloom, a resonance with the unspoken language of your soul.
