A molten core within, a slow, insistent burn.  The surface reflects a restless, yearning light, a desire to rise from the ashes of the past.  A gentle current pulls, urging you to embrace the force that shapes your being – a powerful, unseen current.  It whispers of potential, of a landscape waiting to be sculpted, a space ripe for blossoming.  Consider the warmth radiating from your core, the quiet strength that fuels your movements.  It’s a call to acknowledge the intensity within, to let it guide your choices, not dictate them.  A dance with transformation, a shedding of what no longer serves, revealing a new, vibrant form.  Let the fire within illuminate the path forward, a steady, purposeful flame.
