The ember glows, a hesitant warmth against a vast, darkening space. A path forged in fire, now beginning to cool.  A shadow lengthens, mirroring a decision made with fierce intent.  The flame, though diminished, still holds a potent energy, a restless current pulling at the edges of the known.  It whispers of a transformation, a necessary release of what no longer serves.  Look inward, for the strength that ignited this path resides within your core.  Let the ashes settle, and discover the new landscape waiting to be sculpted.  A quiet understanding dawns – the fire’s essence is not extinguished, but transformed, ready to bloom anew.
