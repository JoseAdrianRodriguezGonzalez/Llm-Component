The vast expanse before you is a still pool, reflecting a shifting, restless surface. A powerful presence emerges, a steady hand guiding the currents. It feels like a weight, a necessary burden, yet also a source of profound clarity.  The reflection holds echoes – fragments of moments past, whispers of forgotten desires.  A gentle pull, a subtle shift in the water’s surface, suggests a truth waiting to be uncovered, a depth within you that resists immediate expression.  Observe the ripples; they carry the weight of experience, the echoes of choices made and paths not taken.  Allow the water to wash over you, cleansing the surface, revealing the hidden landscape of your being.  It is a moment of quiet surrender, a recognition of the strength within the flow.
