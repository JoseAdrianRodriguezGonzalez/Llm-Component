A gentle current, a shifting hue,
Where stillness yields to a whispered plea.
The breath expands, a silent grace,
Across a landscape of time and space.

A balance sought, a measured flow,
Where echoes of intention softly grow.
The mindâ€™s reflection, a mirrored light,
Reflecting truths both dark and bright.

A quiet strength, a thoughtful plea,
To navigate the currents, wild and free.
Observe the pathways, clear and true,
And let the subtle shifts renew.
