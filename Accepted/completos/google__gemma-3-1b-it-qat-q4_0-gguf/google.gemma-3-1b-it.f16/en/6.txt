A molten core within, a slow, insistent burn.  The surface reflects a restless, yearning light, a desire to rise from the ashes of the past.  It pulls, it demands, yet offers a quiet invitation to reshape the landscape of your being.  A warmth radiates outwards, a promise of creation born from a deep, unwavering core.  Consider the echoes of a forgotten dream, the insistent pulse of a nascent purpose.  The fire dances, both illuminating and threatening, urging you to forge a path that resonates with your soul’s true song.  It’s a call to acknowledge the strength that resides within, a willingness to let go of what no longer serves, and to embrace the transformative power of your own will.
