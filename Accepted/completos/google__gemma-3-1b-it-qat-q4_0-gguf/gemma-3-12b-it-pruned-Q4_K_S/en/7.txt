A stillness hangs heavy, the air thick with unsought gifts falling like rain on barren ground. hands clenched unconsciously against what moves past them, unnoticed in a quiet space carved out from urgency. A certain fatigue settles in bone and sinew, a reluctance to reach out into the abundance offered; a turning inward toward shadows and familiar comforts. There is a richness all around, ripe fruit waiting for picking but apathy weighs heavier than hunger. Time slows to molasses viscosity as expectations dissolve into resignation and acceptance settles like dust upon weary shoulders. The world continues to spin brightly outside, indifferent to the silence within.
