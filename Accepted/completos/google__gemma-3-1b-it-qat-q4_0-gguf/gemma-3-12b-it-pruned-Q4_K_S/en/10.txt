Stone rises from shifting currents; solid foundations emerge from yielding depths. Authority manifests not through control, but through the quiet strength found in acknowledging ceaseless change. Structures assemble themselves from fluidity; boundaries define not restriction but containment for surging tides within. There is stillness at the center of storms, a stillness born not of absence but of absorption. What appears rigid holds oceans within its heart; stability radiates from recognition of the ever present flow beneath surface appearances. This is governance forged in compassion; reign born of understanding the ceaseless ebb and endless return. An unwavering gaze reflects not judgment but knowing acknowledgement of what moves beneath.
