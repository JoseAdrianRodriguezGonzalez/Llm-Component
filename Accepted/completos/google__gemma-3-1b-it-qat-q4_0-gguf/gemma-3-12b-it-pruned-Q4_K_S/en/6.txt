Reflections shimmer on water stained amber hues. laughter echoes distantly, carried on warmth rising from ancient stones. foundations shift beneath currents of joyous resonance; circles complete themselves in shimmering waves, mirroring skies painted azure, tinged with sunset gold. There is recognition in stillness, a quiet blooming after intense heat; blossoms unfurling in fertile ground nourished by embers cooled. See the fullness arrive, not as upheaval, but as gentle settling â€“ a homecoming etched into heartwood, felt deep within bones, a culmination radiating outwards like heat rising from hearth fires, drawing all into a embrace of tender belonging. Time slows and expands into infinite sky.
