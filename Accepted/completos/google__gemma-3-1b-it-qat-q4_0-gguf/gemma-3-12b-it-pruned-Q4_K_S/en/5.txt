Sharp edges define boundaries; clarity cuts through fog. A voice rings out, measured and precise, dissecting layers to reveal what lies beneath surface appearances. Authority resides not in warmth, but in discernment â€“ a stillness that observes and understands without sentimentality. There is strength in unwavering honesty, a refusal to bend to pressures designed to obscure the truth. What is built must be examined; what is promised must be scrutinized; what is real cannot hide from piercing eyes that seek only accuracy. This is a moment for reckoning, for pruning excess growth, for standing firm in unyielding integrity as foundations are tested against the realities of stone and soil.
