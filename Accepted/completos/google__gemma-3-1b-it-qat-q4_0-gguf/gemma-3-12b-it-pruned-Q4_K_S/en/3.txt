The embers have faded. smoke curls upward carrying fragments of what was built against the skyâ€™s darkening canvas. There is stillness now, a quiet aftermath where embers settle into ash beneath footfalls echoing faintly in emptied chambers. Release is etched into the landscape, a clearing carved by necessity after intense heat. This stillness holds seeds waiting for rain; a patient exhale before renewal stirs beneath the surface of what remains. Acceptance descends like twilight; not an ending but a turning towards shadows where unforeseen possibilities lie dormant and ready to ignite when the time arrives. Trust the stillness; listen for the whispers beneath the silence; there is resilience woven into the ashes themselves.
