The weight of a vast, still expanse settles upon you. A quiet current pulls, revealing a landscape of hidden depths.  The surface reflects a strength, a solid foundation, yet beneath, a restless, shifting sea whispers of forgotten tides.  It speaks of a profound, unwavering core, a wellspring of feeling both powerful and vulnerable.  

The echoes of past experiences ripple through this reflective space, shaping the contours of your present.  A gentle, insistent pull towards understanding, a yearning to connect with the unspoken language of your own heart.  Allow the water to cleanse, to reveal the patterns within, the currents that guide your actions.  It is a call to trust the intuition that resides within, a recognition that your emotional landscape is a map to your true self.  Seek not to control the flow, but to become a witness to its unfolding.
