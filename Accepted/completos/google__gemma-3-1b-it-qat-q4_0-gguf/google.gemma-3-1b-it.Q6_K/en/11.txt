A gentle current, a shifting hue,
Where stillness meets a whispered plea.
The breath expands, a silver grace,
Across a landscape of inner space.

A quiet offering, a measured flow,
Of thoughts taking root, beginning to grow.
The air remembers echoes, faint and low,
Of possibilities yet to bestow.

A dance of balance, a thoughtful plea,
To weave intentions, authentically free.
Observe the ripples, subtle and bright,
As clarity emerges in the fading light.
