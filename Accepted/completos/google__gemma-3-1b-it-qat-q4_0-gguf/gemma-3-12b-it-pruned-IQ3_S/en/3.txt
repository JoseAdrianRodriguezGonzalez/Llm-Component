The embers settle into twilight’s grey expanse; a stillness descends after upheaval’s roar. Shadowed wings collapse the sky’s bright promise, leaving only the echoes of momentum lost. A shattered altar lies strewn across the landscape’s scars; relics of fervor now scattered like fallen leaves. There is a chilling solitude in this aftermath — a quiet surrender to what has passed. The heat fades into a residue of remembrance; a bitter sweetness lingers on the tongue. From the ashes rises a whispered understanding; strength found not in blazing glory but in the acceptance of endings shaped by will itself. A new horizon waits just beyond the darkness – illuminated by the memory of sacrifice. The remnants hold lessons etched in stone.
