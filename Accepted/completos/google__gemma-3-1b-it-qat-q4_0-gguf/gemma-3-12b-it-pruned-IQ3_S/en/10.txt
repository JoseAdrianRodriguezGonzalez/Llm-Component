The stones shift beneath pressure; a summit achieved not through lightness, but steadfastness. There’s strength in the silence of the mountain’s heart, a quiet sovereignty over the valleys below – not dominance, but a watchful presence. It’s the echo of storms absorbed into the bedrock, transformed into resilience. A boundary holds firm, not to exclude, but to define space; to create containment for currents that would otherwise flood all else. A structured stillness where fragility finds its foundation; where the deepest tides settle into unwavering certainty. The landscape is sculpted by what remains after the turbulence subsides. The air holds the scent of pine, and stone remembers the weight of skies above.
