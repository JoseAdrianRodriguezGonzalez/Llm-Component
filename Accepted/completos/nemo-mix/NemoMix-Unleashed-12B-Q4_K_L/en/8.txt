The harvest of your labors lies before you, a bountiful field of pentacles ripe for the taking. Yet pause, for the true measure of your wealth is not in the coin but in the soil that nurtured its growth. Tread lightly upon the earth, for it is the vessel that holds the seeds of your future. In this moment of plenty, reflect on the seeds you have sown and the harvests yet to come.
