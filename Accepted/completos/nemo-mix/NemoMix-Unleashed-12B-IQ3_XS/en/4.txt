In the depths of the subconscious, a mirror reflects the hidden currents of the soul. Emotions ebb and flow like tides, revealing the intimate landscape of the psyche. To navigate these waters, one must dive deep, embracing the turbulence and stillness alike. For it is in the depths that we find the truth of ourselves, the forgotten wisdom that guides us home. The ripples of empathy connect us to others, allowing us to understand the shared experiences that bind us. To honor our emotional sensitivity is to honor the very essence of our humanity, for it is through feeling that we truly come to know ourselves and the world around us.
