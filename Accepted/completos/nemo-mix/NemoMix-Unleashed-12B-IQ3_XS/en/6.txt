In the dance of creation, a spark ignites, a beacon in the night. This flame, your will, a force to shape the clay of dreams. It burns away the old, forges new paths, and in its light, you see your truest self. This fire, your passion, a compass to guide you home. It fuels your journey, a journey of self-discovery and transformation. Embrace the heat, let it temper your spirit, and rise from the ashes, reborn.
