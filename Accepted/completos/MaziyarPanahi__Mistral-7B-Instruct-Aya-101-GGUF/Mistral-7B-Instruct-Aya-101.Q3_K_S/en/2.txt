In the descent,
You've touched the soil.
You've held
Your dreams in your hands,

Sculpted by your heart,
Brewed in your soul.

This Ace of Cups,
This Earth card,
Offers a taste of your reality.

Drink it in.

Reflect on its essence.

What lies within?

Ask and see.

What's the nourishment you'll sow?
In your thoughts, your heart,
Your deeds, and your land.

To manifest your dreams,
To fertilize your life.

What treasures dwell
In the depths of your being?

Unearth them.
