The Ten of Swords is a card of transformation and rebirth. It symbolizes the power of the divine spark within us, the energy that drives us to manifest our will in the physical world. It represents the need to recognize and channel our inner strength, to use it consciously and deliberately. The Ten of Swords invites us to reflect on the authentic desires that motivate our actions and decisions, and to align them with a higher purpose. It challenges us to purify ourselves, to let go of the old and obsolete, and to make room for new creations.
