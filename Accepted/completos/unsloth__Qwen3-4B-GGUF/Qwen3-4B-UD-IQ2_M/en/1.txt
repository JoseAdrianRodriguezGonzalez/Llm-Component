The earth’s embrace holds your roots, a stone that stands in stillness, its weight a quiet anchor. Roots hum beneath the soil, a whisper of earth’s breath, weaving through the tangible echoes of your being. Where stone meets soil, the weight of roots presses into the earth’s stillness, a quiet echo of strength in the hum of the ground. The earth’s breath is in the stillness of roots, in the weight of stone, in the hum of the earth’s breath that binds all things. A root, a stone, the earth’s breath—stillness, weight, hum, and the echo of roots in the earth’s breath.
