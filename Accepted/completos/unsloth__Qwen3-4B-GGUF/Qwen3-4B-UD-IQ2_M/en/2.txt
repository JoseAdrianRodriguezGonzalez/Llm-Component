The river of time flows through your hands, a quiet ripple of water and earth, where the first bloom of a flower meets the soil of the earth. Your path is woven with the rhythm of the earth’s breath, a cycle of roots and rivers, of light and shadow. The weight of your past is a seed, now blooming into the fragile, fleeting beauty of a cup. The earth holds your breath, a silent promise of growth, of sustenance, of the quiet hum of life. In the spaces between, where the sky meets the soil, your story unfolds—a thread of water, a thread of earth, both fleeting and eternal. The world turns, but you are rooted in the rhythm of what is.
