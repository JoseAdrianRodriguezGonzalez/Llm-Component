Beneath the surface, where light meets shadow, a current stirs—deep, unyielding, yet shaped by the weight of unseen forces. The tides of the soul rise and fall in rhythms older than memory, carrying echoes of what is held close and what is left behind. In the stillness between waves, a foundation forms, not of stone, but of roots entwined with the hidden currents of feeling. Here, the heart learns to hold both the storm and the silence, to let the water of its own making carve paths where logic once faltered. The depths hum with a quiet authority, a presence that does not demand but insists on being known. In this space, the self becomes a vessel, not of control, but of surrender—where the familiar and the unknown meet, and the water remembers its own shape.
