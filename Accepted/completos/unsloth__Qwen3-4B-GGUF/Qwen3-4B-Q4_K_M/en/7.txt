The earth holds its breath beneath the weight of what is not yet, its roots tangled in the silence of unmet need. Stones press against the soil, stubborn and unyielding, while the ground itself seems to hold its breath, waiting for something to take root in the spaces between. The land, once fertile, now bears the mark of stagnation, its surface cracked by the tension between what is held and what is left behind. In the stillness, a question lingersâ€”what is being left to grow, and what is being held back by the hands of the earth? The soil, though rich with potential, hums with the absence of a seed that has not yet found its way.
