A stillness in the earth, where the weight of unmet longing presses against the soil, holding the shape of what has not yet been claimed. The ground does not move, but it remembers the pull of what was once held close, the quiet ache of a world that has not yet yielded to the need it carries. Roots stretch not toward the sky, but toward the depths of what has been left behind, a silent resistance to the shift that must come. The air hums with the weight of a decision not yet made, a stillness that does not belong to the earth but to the things it cannot hold. Here, the material and the unseen meet, and the ground, ever patient, offers its silence as a vessel for the things that cannot be rushed. The world is not broken; it is being held, one quiet, unshaken truth at a time.
