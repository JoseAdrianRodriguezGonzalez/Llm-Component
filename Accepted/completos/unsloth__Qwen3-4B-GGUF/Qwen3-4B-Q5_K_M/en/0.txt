A whisper of movement beneath the surface, where currents of will meet the tide of unseen depths. The world hums with a quiet pulse, a rhythm that bends and shifts like water caught in the breath of a new dawn. Shadows ripple, not with fear, but with the quiet certainty of something stirringâ€”something that flows not through force, but through the spaces between. Here, the weight of the unseen presses against the edges of the known, and the heart, a vessel of stillness, holds the shape of a question that has no answer yet. The water does not resist; it carries, as if the very air is made of longing. In this space, the future is not a destination but a tide, and the soul, a leaf, drifts toward the horizon where the sky and sea meet in a language only the deep can understand.
