A flame that dances in the heart, casting long shadows on the edges of a gathering, where warmth and tension coexist. The air hums with the weight of unspoken desires, a fire that burns not to consume but to refine, to shape what is held close into something luminous and whole. In the stillness between sparks, a mirror is formedâ€”of laughter, of longing, of the quiet force that moves unseen yet insists on being felt. The flames rise in patterns, a language of urgency and peace, reminding that the deepest connections are forged not in the blaze, but in the space where the fire has cleared the way. A cup filled with the echoes of what was, now cradling the spark of what is to come, as if the world itself is holding its breath between the old and the new.
