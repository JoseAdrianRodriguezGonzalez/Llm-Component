Beneath the weight of stillness, roots stretch toward the earth, seeking the quiet hum of what is held but not yet claimed. The soil, rich with the memory of what was sown, holds a tension between what is gathered and what remains unspoken. A field of shadows stretches outward, its edges blurred by the weight of unmet needs, while the air carries the scent of something just out of reach. The ground, though steady, holds a quiet acheâ€”like the space between a hand and a cup, full but unspilling. Here, the tangible and the unseen weave together, a fragile balance between what is held and what is left to grow. The earth breathes in the silence between offerings and what is not taken, a reminder that even in stillness, the seed of something new may be waiting to take root.
