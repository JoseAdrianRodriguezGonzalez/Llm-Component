A flame once fierce now smolders in the ash of a forgotten hearth, its embers flickering with the memory of a will that refused to bend. The air hums with the weight of a struggle that has been carried in silence, a fire that burned too bright to be contained, leaving behind a landscape of shadows and half-remembered sparks. Yet in the stillness, a whisper of heat lingersâ€”a reminder that even the most extinguished flame holds the seed of a new beginning. The world around you is a tapestry of tension, where the pulse of desire and the ache of restraint dance in a fragile balance. Let the fire within you be both a question and an answer, a force that shapes what is left behind and what is yet to be born. The path is not in the blaze, but in the quiet before the next spark.
