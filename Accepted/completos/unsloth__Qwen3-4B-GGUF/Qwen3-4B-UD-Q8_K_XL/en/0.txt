A hidden current beneath the surface stirs, a whisper of unseen tides shaping the contours of the soul. The mirror of the heart reflects not just what is seen, but the depths where intuition and feeling entwine, guiding the unseen path. A river of emotion flows, not always calm, but ever moving, carrying the weight of forgotten truths and the quiet strength of empathy. In its depths, the echo of the unseen speaks, a language of feeling that binds the self to the world. The water, once still, now moves with purpose, a current that carries the soul toward the unknown, where the boundaries between self and other dissolve into the vast, uncharted tide.
