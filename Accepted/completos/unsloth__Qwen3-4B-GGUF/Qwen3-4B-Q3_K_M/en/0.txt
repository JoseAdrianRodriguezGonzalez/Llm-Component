The currents of your being shift, carrying you through unseen depths where the tides of feeling rise and fall like a restless tide. Here, the young force of movement meets the stillness of the inner sea, where echoes of past and future ripple in tandem. You are drawn to the edges of the known, where the water hums with the weight of unspoken truths, and the path ahead is not marked by landmarks but by the pull of intuition. In this space, the familiar and the unknown blend, and the act of moving becomes an offering to the unseen currents that guide you. You are both the vessel and the tide, navigating the resonance of emotions that have long been submerged, now surfacing in quiet, uncharted ways. Trust the flow, even when it seems to resist, for in the stillness between waves, the hidden map of your soul begins to take shape.
