The Queen of Pentacles stands, a quiet, unwavering presence, bathed in the gentle glow of a still, reflective pool. She holds a single, perfect stone, a miniature representation of a steadfast, deeply felt truth. Look into her eyes – a vast, unyielding space – and feel the weight of accumulated wisdom. She doesn't demand, but simply *is*.  Her strength isn't outward, but resides within a profound, almost impenetrable, core.  She is the embodiment of a deeply felt need, a quiet insistence that demands respect and careful consideration.  Consider the stillness, the potential for profound, unexpressed emotion.  She invites you to acknowledge the subtle currents of your own heart, to understand the roots of your decisions, and to allow the quiet power of your own intuition to guide you through the complexities of your own being.
