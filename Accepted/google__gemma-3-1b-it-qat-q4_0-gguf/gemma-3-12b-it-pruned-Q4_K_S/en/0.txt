Sunlight dances on surface ripples; a breath stirs the stillness above. Something new rises from currents unseen––impulsive sparks ignited beneath layers of reflection. A restless energy stirs within depths long held quiet, an urge to venture where shadows shift and dissolve into liquid moonlight. There is innocence in this movement, a eager exploration of landscapes mirrored within. Possibilities shimmer like fish darting through weeds; a sudden understanding blooms, brief and bright as surface foam before sinking back into the boundless sea. Trust the buoyancy; follow where the tides pull—there lies unexpected brilliance waiting to be found.
