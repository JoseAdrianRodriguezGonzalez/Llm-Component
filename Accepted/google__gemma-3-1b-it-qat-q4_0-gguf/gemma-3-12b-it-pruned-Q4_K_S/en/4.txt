The earth breathes beneath a steady sky, fertile and calm; nourishment blooms quietly where roots run deep. There is a quiet strength in abundance, a grounding force that draws sustenance from unseen currents below. This isnâ€™ve a raging storm, but the patient settling of dew after rain; a yielding openness in the face of tides unseen. Something grows here, nurtured by steady devotion and a quiet understanding of cycles completed and beginning anew. There is solace in creation and responsibility embraced with grace; a bountiful harvest born of careful tending to the seeds within. Trust in the slow turning of seasons; trust in the yielding earth beneath your feet.
