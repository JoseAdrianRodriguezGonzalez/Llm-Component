The swirling embers of a nascent dream ignite within you, a fierce, insistent pull towards a future you’ve only glimpsed. A potent current surges, demanding to be unleashed.  The warmth of your will is a beacon, demanding to be focused.  Shadows cling, remnants of past decisions, but their power is diminished by the burgeoning flame.  A journey of transformation begins, a shedding of what no longer serves your purpose.  Trust the core of your being, the unwavering spark within.  Let the energy of creation flow, reshaping the landscape of your reality.  Observe the dance of intention – how your drive shapes the world around you.  Seek clarity; the path forward is not a straight line, but a passionate, transformative burn.
