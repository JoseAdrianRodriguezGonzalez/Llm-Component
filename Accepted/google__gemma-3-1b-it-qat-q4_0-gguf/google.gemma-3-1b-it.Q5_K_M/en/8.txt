The earth’s embrace holds a quiet strength. A grounding presence, it whispers of roots reaching deep, anchoring you to the solid ground of your being.  A slow unfolding, a gathering of resources – both internal and external – reveals a potential for profound stability.  Consider the weight of your actions, the echoes of your intentions, carried upon the surface.  The earth’s quiet insistence urges you to examine the tangible threads that connect your spirit to the world around you.  Are you nurturing the fertile soil of your own well-being, or allowing it to be depleted by external pressures?  A careful assessment reveals a pathway to balance – a willingness to honor the resources available, while simultaneously cultivating a mindful relationship with the physical realm.  Let the earth’s stillness offer a mirror, reflecting the truth of your commitment to a sustainable existence.
