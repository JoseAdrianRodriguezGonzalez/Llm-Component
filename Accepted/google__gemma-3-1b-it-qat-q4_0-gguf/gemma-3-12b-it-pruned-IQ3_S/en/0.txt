The air holds the scent of rain on warm earth; a new impulse trembles beneath the surface, shimmering like sunlight on rippling water. A tremor of eagerness, barely formed, reaches out with trembling fingers towards the horizon’s embrace. Not a thunderous crash of waves, but the quiet splash of discovery—a ripple expanding outward from a single point of wonder. There is an openness here, a vulnerability like petals unfolding; a whisper of possibility carried on the breeze before the storms arrive and the currents shift. A seedling pushes upward from fertile ground, trusting instincts over maps, guided by an inner compass toward unknown shores. The echoes of yesterday fade into the gentle murmur of tides to come.
