The quiet settles heavy around blossoms untouched by the hand. A coolness lingers where warmth should reside – a pause held too long, perhaps. There’s an echo of abundance, felt but not grasped; a gift offered, overlooked amidst the shadows of what was expected. A stillness blooms; not of contentment necessarily, but of contemplative solitude – a turning inward where stones lie smooth beneath mossy roots. A recognition dawns, not of lack, but of choices made; paths not taken; a delicate orchestration of letting go to make way for autumn’s slow descent into the soil’s embrace. A softening begins; a quiet acceptance of the present moment’sa gentle melancholy. And in this stillness, seeds await their time to stir.
