Water spills forth from unseen springs, saturating soil long parched by silence. A blush blooms, not of urgency, but of quiet arrival – a promise whispered into grains of sand. The vessels gather what they can, accepting abundance without grasping. There is a swelling, a softening of edges where once there was only contour. It is not about building walls, but about offering space; not about possession, but about letting flow. A fragrant offering rises, dissolving into air like vaporous prayers – a new terrain emerges from the depths of acceptance, ripe with possibility for seeding untold stories. A resonance echoes, felt more than heard; a gentle tremor beneath the surface of what was known before.
