A ripple begins, a dark pool reflecting a distant shore.  The current pulls, insistent, demanding to be understood.  A hidden current flows within, a persistent melody of feeling.  It seeks to surface, to be seen, to be acknowledged.  The surface whispers of forgotten joys and shadowed sorrows, a landscape of the soul laid bare.  It urges a gentle surrender to the ebb and flow, to allow the depths to breathe.  A quiet invitation to trust the intuition that guides, not to force a path, but to simply *be* within the shifting waters.  Let the reflection deepen, and the truth emerge, not as a fixed point, but as a continuous, evolving understanding.
