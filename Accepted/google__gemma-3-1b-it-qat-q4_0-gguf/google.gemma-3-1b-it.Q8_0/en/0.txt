A ripple begins, a dark pool reflecting a distant shore.  The current pulls, insistent and slow, revealing a hidden current within yourself.  A gentle pressure builds, a yearning for the depths, a quiet knowing that echoes beneath the surface.  Fragments of remembered warmth, perhaps lost or obscured, surface with a hesitant grace.  

The water shifts, revealing a landscape of possibilities, both comforting and challenging.  It speaks of a profound connection – a resonance with the shared experience of others, a mirroring of their joys and sorrows.  

There’s a pull towards acceptance, a surrender to the ebb and flow of feeling.  It’s a moment to observe, to let the currents guide you, without resistance.  A quiet invitation to trust the wisdom held within your own emotional landscape – a space of profound understanding waiting to be unveiled.
