A gentle current, a shifting hue,
Where stillness yields to a whispered plea.
The breath expands, a silver grace,
Across a landscape of inner space.

A balance sought, a measured flow,
Where echoes of thought begin to grow.
A quiet strength, a thoughtful plea,
To navigate the currents, you and me.

The air reveals a pathway unseen,
A resonance of what might have been.
Observe the subtle dance of words,
And let the silent wisdom be heard.
