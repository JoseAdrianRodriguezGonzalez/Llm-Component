The ember glows within, a slow, deliberate burn.  A shadow stretches long, mirroring a journey undertaken, a path illuminated by a fierce, unwavering light.  It’s a reckoning, a moment of intense focus, a deliberate choice to confront the inevitable.  The weight of what was, settles heavy, yet a nascent strength begins to stir.  It’s a pull towards a clearing, a space where the old can be released, allowing new growth to blossom.  The flame remembers its origin, a potent source of transformation, but it’s not a constant blaze.  It’s a controlled release, a necessary sacrifice to pave the way for something more substantial.  Consider the echoes of your own fire – what remains, what is truly yours to hold?
