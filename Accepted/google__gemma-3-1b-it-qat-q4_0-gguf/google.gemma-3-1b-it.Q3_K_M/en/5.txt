The earth shifts beneath your feet, a slow, deliberate unfolding. A quiet strength resides within, a grounding force amidst the swirling currents of your being.  It’s a recognition of the tangible echoes of your heart, the very essence of what you hold dear.  Consider the weight of your intentions, the fertile ground where they’re planted.  There’s a pull towards what is solid, a desire to anchor your beliefs to a stable reality.  Yet, a subtle tension exists – a need to relinquish what no longer serves you, to allow the natural flow of resources to nurture new growth.  The earth whispers of a necessary balance, a careful stewardship of the gifts you’ve gathered.  It asks you to examine the landscape of your life – the tangible and the intangible – and to ensure your path remains rooted in a sustainable, unwavering foundation.
