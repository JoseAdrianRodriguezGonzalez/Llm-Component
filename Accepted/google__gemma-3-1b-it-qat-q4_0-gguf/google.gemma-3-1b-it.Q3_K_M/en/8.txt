The weight of potential, held within the soil, feels heavy.  There’s a gentle pull towards what is solid, what holds form and substance.  Consider the space between your actions and your intentions – a delicate balance awaiting alignment.  The earth offers a chance to examine the tangible impact of your choices, the resources you’ve cultivated, and the environment you’ve shaped.  A quiet strength emerges from this grounded perspective – a recognition of the enduring power of persistence.  It asks you to nurture the roots of your being, ensuring a sustainable foundation for your future.
