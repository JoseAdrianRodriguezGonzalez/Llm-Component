In the quiet expanse of a well-tended garden, the Four of Cups lies half-buried, its image etched into the earth itself. Here, the tangible meets the intangible, a silent testament to the passage of time and the imprint of human desire. The earth, rich and dark, holds the imprint of a hand that once reached for something just beyond grasp. It is a reminder that what we seek may lie just beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to be unearthed. This card speaks of a resource, a well of potential, that is as much a part of the landscape as the stones beneath which it resides. It is a call to look beyond the immediate, to see the connections that bind the physical to the spiritual, and to understand that the nourishment we crave is often found in the very ground we stand upon.
