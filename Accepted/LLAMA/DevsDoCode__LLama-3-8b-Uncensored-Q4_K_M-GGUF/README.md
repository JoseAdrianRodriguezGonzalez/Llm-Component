### GGUF Technical Specifications 

Delve into the intricacies of GGUF, a meticulously crafted format that builds upon the robust foundation of the GGJT model. Tailored for heightened extensibility and user-centric functionality, GGUF introduces a suite of indispensable features:

**Single-file Deployment:** Streamline distribution and loading effortlessly. GGUF models have been meticulously architected for seamless deployment, necessitating no external files for supplementary information.

**Extensibility:** Safeguard the future of your models. GGUF seamlessly accommodates the integration of new features into GGML-based executors, ensuring compatibility with existing models.

**mmap Compatibility:** Prioritize efficiency. GGUF models are purposefully engineered to support mmap, facilitating rapid loading and saving, thus optimizing your workflow.

**User-Friendly:** Simplify your coding endeavors. Load and save models effortlessly, irrespective of the programming language used, obviating the dependency on external libraries.

**Full Information:** A comprehensive repository in a single file. GGUF models encapsulate all requisite information for loading, eliminating the need for users to furnish additional data.

The differentiator between GGJT and GGUF lies in the deliberate adoption of a key-value structure for hyperparameters (now termed metadata). Bid farewell to untyped lists, and embrace a structured approach that seamlessly accommodates new metadata without compromising compatibility with existing models. Augment your model with supplementary information for enhanced inference and model identification.
