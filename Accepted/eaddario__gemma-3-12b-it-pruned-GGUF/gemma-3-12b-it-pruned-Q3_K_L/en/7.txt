Stillness hangs heavy, a quiet pool reflecting skies unseen. Offered gifts lie untouched, nestled amongst stones worn smooth by time and water. There is a stillness here, not of peace necessarily, but of contemplation suspended mid-breath. A turning away from currents flowing past, a choosing to remain rooted where shadows lengthen and sunlight fades. A quiet acceptance settles like dust motes dancing in beams, a stillness holding space for something else entirely â€“ a slow turning inward towards landscapes unseen beneath the surface. A deepening silence where seeds wait patiently for rain that may never come.
