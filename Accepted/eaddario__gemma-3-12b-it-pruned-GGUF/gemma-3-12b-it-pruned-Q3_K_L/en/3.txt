The embers settle into ash, a stillness descends upon the landscape where flames once danced with wild abandon. A sudden clarity blooms from the wreckage; the heat subsides revealing contours previously obscured by blazing intensity. There is release in surrender, a quiet acceptance of endings etched into the earth beneath feet now grounded and steady. What was once consumed now feeds a quiet resilience, a stillness pregnant with possibility born from dissolution. A stillness where seeds lie dormant awaiting a gentle rain, ready to rise from ashes transformed into something new.
