A gentle current stirs the stillness, a delicate balance held suspended between opposing tides. See how the waters shift and merge, reflecting skies of shifting hues. There is movement in stillness; a quiet flow shaping boundaries without force. Observe the dance of feathers caught on breezes, carrying whispers across vast expansions. Listen closely; hear the resonance of unspoken truths settling into quiet spaces between breaths. A delicate harmony emerges from the mingling of currents; a quiet understanding blooms where turbulence once reigned. Let go of grasping; surrender to the gentle drift. Allow yourself to be carried by currents unseen, towards horizons painted with possibility.
