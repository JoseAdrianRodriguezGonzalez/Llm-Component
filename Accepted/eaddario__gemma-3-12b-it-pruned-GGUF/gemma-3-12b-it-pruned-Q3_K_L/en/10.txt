Stone rises from shifting currents, a solid form carved from liquid dreams. Authority rests not in command, but in the unwavering stillness at the heart of motion. Boundaries define not limitation, but the space where strength takes root and blooms. A crown reflects sunlight filtered through depths unknown; it holds not power over tides, but the quiet confidence of one who understands their ebb and flow. Structure emerges from fluidity; order blooms from chaos; stability finds purchase where waters swirl and converge. A kingdom built not on suppression of feeling, but on the mastery of its currents.
