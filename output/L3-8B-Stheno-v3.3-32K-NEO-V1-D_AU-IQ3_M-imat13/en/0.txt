The Page of Wands, the Water card, appears in this reading. Water, that primal force of nature, flows through the veins of our being, carrying with it the tides of our emotions. In the realm of Tarot, Water represents the depths of our psyche, the hidden corners where feelings reside. It is the element of intuition, of gut-wrenching sensations that defy logic. Water is the mirror we hold up to ourselves, reflecting back the truths we often keep buried. In this context, the Page of Wands suggests a journey inward, a dive into the churning waters of our own mind and heart. It invites us to immerse ourselves in the tempest of our emotions, to swim through the currents of feeling and emerge with a clearer understanding of who we are beneath the surface. The Water card is a reminder that our emotions are not enemies, but essential guides on the path to self-knowledge. They are the compass that points us toward our authentic selves, the map that charts the uncharted territories of the soul. In the hands of the Water card, we are called to explore the depths, to dive beneath the surface and confront the secrets we keep from ourselves. Only then can we hope to find the treasures that lie hidden in the depths.
