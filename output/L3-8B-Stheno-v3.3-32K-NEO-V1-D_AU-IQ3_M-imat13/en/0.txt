The Page of Wands, the Water card, emerges from the depths of the subconscious, a symbol of the hidden currents that flow beneath the surface of our awareness. In the realm of emotions, Water represents the ebb and flow of feelings, the tides that carry us through the depths of our being. It is a reminder to dive beneath the surface, to immerse ourselves in the vast ocean of our inner world. Here, we may find forgotten truths and long-buried desires, the seeds of creativity and passion that lie dormant, waiting to be awakened. The Page of Wands invites us to explore the uncharted territories of our psyche, to navigate the churning waters of our emotions with courage and curiosity. It is a call to embrace the full spectrum of our feelings, to dance with the turbulence and find the hidden gems that lie within. In the depths of Water, we may discover the source of our strength, the wellspring of our intuition, and the key to unlocking our authentic power.
