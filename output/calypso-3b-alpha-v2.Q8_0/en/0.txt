 [INST] The sun shining down on the face of the earth is a symbol of spiritual growth and the development of new consciousness. The light of new ideas and new understandings that come from the sun gives us a sense of renewal and new beginnings. It is the divine energy that provides the spark that will ignite an inner fire of transformation. As the sun shines down on the earth, it also gives us the sense of hope and the possibility of change. The sun is a symbol of purification and transformation.  [/INST]
