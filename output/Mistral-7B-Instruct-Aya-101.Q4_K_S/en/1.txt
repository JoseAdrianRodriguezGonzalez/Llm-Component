The Earth card, a symbol of tangible reality, invites us to reflect on our connection to the material world. It challenges us to consider how our beliefs and emotions manifest in our daily practices, particularly in the areas of resources, health, and the environment. This card offers an opportunity for alignment, encouraging us to nurture our values and cultivate a sustainable approach to life.
