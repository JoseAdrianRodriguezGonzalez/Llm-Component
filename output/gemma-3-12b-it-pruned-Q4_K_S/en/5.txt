Sharp edges define boundaries; clarity cuts through fog. There is strength in discernment, a stillness born of observation. A fortress stands against shifting sands, guarding treasures both seen and unseen. Words are weapons forged with precision; truths revealed demand acknowledgment. Authority resides not in dominion but in unwavering integrity, a quiet vigilance over what sustains life and what diminishes it. A gaze pierces illusion; judgment is tempered by understanding. What remains is resilience rooted deep within the earth itself.
