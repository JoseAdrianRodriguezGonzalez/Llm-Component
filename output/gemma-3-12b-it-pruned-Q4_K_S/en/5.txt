Sharp edges define boundaries; clarity cuts through fog. There is a stillness born of discernment, a quiet strength rooted deep within stone. Words are weapons forged with precision, piercing through illusion to reveal what lies beneath the surface. A gaze holds judgment and understanding in equal measure; no sentimentality clouds the vision. This is not about building empires of earth and gold, but about safeguarding what is essential â€“ integrity, truth, and the ability to stand firm against shifting sands. A fortress of intellect protects vulnerability; boundaries are not walls but shields against storms. There is sovereignty here, a quiet authority born not of possession but of unwavering conviction.
