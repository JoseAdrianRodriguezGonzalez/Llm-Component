A spark ignites upon currents unseen, carried by tides pulling towards horizons unknown. There is a restless energy stirring beneath surface calm, a sudden surge of inspiration rising from depths long held quiet. A vibrant hue blooms within the stillness; a whisper of possibility dances on the waves. Trust the impulse to venture forth, even when direction remains veiled in mist. Embrace the fluidity of feeling; let it guide you towards shores yet imagined, where new landscapes await unveiling. A journey begins not with destination in sight, but with the courage to release into the flow. There is joy in exploration; revelation in surrender.
