A sudden spring blooms within the stone. Water spills forth, not in torrent but in gentle overflow, filling cracks with shimmering promise. Something new rises from the bedrock, a quiet abundance felt deep within bone and soil. There is nourishment here, not earned but given freely; a sudden warmth against the chill of expectation. It flows outward, connecting all things in a silent current, a shared breath beneath the surface of things. Let it settle into the roots; let it nourish what lies dormant. Trust the stillness; trust the outpouring. There is abundance enough for all.
