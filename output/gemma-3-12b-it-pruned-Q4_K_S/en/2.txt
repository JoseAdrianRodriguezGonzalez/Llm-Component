A sudden spring blooms within the stone. Water spills forth, not in torrent but in gentle overflow, filling cracks with unexpected tenderness. Something new rises from the bedrock, shimmering with potential held captive for ages. There is abundance here, not measured in piles but felt in the quiet expansion of space around the heart. nourishment flows freely, a silent promise whispered into the soil â€“ roots reach deep, seeking sustenance not just for survival but for vibrant flourishing. A stillness settles; a fertile pause before growth explodes into unforeseen beauty. It is a beginning born of patient waiting.
