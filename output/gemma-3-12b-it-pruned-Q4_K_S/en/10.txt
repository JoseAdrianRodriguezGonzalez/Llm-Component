Stone rises from shifting currents, a fortress built upon tides unseen. Authority settles into stillness, a calm center amidst swirling depths. Boundaries harden, not as walls of separation, but as channels directing the flow â€“ shaping the turbulence into purposeful movement. There is strength in restraint, a quiet confidence born of acknowledging the boundless expanse below. Structure emerges from fluidity; order finds its place within the ever changing landscape of feeling. A throne rests upon liquid foundations; sovereignty resides in accepting the ebb and flow of existence itself. Power lies not in controlling the waters, but in understanding their rhythms.
