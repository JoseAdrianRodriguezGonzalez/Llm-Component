Stone rises from shifting currents, a fortress built upon tides unseen. Authority settles into stillness, a calm center amidst swirling depths. Boundaries harden where waters once dissolved all edges; structure emerges from fluidity, a deliberate shaping of what was boundless. There is strength in containment, a quiet dominion born of acknowledging the vastness within. A crown reflects the sky above, mirroring both clarity and distance; power resides not in controlling the flow, but in anchoring oneself within it. Echoes resonate from ages past, lessons etched in stone and carried on currents of memory. The heart finds its measure in the stillness at the eye of the storm.
