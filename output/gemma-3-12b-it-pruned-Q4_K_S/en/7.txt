A stillness settles, heavy as moss clinging to stone. Offerings lie disregarded, spilling into dust motes dancing in dim light. There is a turning away from gifts presented, a quiet refusal woven into the stillness of afternoon shadows. A sense of saturation hangs in the air; too much abundance becomes a burden, a weight pressing down upon the roots. The earth holds secrets beneath layers of leaf litter; nourishment waits patiently beneath the surface, but recognition requires a lifting of gaze from what lies discarded at hand. A pause is necessary; a letting go to make space for what may bloom anew from fertile ground.
