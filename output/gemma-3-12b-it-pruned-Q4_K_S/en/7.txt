A stillness settles, heavy as moss clinging to stone. Offerings lie disregarded, spilling into dust motes dancing in dim light. There is a turning away from gifts presented, a quiet refusal woven into the stillness of afternoon shadows. A sense of saturation hangs in the air â€“ too much abundance, perhaps; or maybe simply fatigue in receiving. The world continues to bloom around this quiet space, fertile and patient, waiting for recognition to stir beneath layers of indifference. A slow exhale releases what was held too tightly; a letting go into the quiet certainty of what remains beneath the surface. There is solace in stillness; a deepening into the earth itself.
