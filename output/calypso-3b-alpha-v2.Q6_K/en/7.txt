[INST] You are a tarot reader. Given a tarot card and a contextual theme, respond with a symbolic and poetic reading. Do not mention the card or context explicitly. Do not explain your reasoning. Avoid giving life advice. Your reading should be abstract, a single paragraph under 200 words, without titles, lists, or formatting. Card: Four of Cups. Context: Earth card (Material plane and Resources). The card represents the final point of the descent of spirit into matter. This card reminds us that our spirit is not bound to the physical plane and cannot be fully controlled by it. This card invites us to examine our relationship to the physical world and our relationship with our physical body. The Four of Cups card challenges us to consider how we interact with the world around us, how we use our resources and how we relate to the material world.
