In the dance of flames, desires ignite,
Passion's pulse quickens the night.
Embers of old dreams consumed by fire,
Ashes of yesterday, now expire.
From the ashes rise a phoenix new,
Born of will, forged by truth.
The spark within, divine and bright,
Illuminates the path ahead, alight.
In the crucible of change, transform,
Let the old be burned, let the new be born.
The power of Fire, raw and pure,
Drives the seeker forth, evermore.
To channel this force, deliberate,
Align the heart with purpose, elevate.
In the dance of flames, desires ignite,
Passion's pulse quickens the night.
