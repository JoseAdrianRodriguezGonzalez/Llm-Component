Tides of the subconscious ripple beneath a surface of stillness, where the weight of unseen currents shapes the contours of the soul. A stone beneath the waves holds the echo of forgotten depths, its roots entwined with the pulse of hidden truths. The mirror of the soul reflects not just what is seen, but the quiet tremors of what lingers just beyond reachâ€”shadows that whisper of unspoken needs, the silent language of the heart. In this space, the boundary between self and other dissolves, as the flow of feeling becomes a bridge, not a barrier. The unseen force that anchors the storm within finds its rhythm in the ebb and flow of empathy, where the quiet strength of presence meets the vastness of the unknown. Here, the act of holding still becomes a form of surrender, and the depths of feeling are not feared, but honored as the wellspring of all that is unseen yet vital.
