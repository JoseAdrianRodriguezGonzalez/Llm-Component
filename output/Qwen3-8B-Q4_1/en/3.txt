A storm of embers lingers beneath the surface, where shadows of past burdens smolder into ash. The breath of a flame flickers through cracks, urging the unseen to rise, to dissolve the weight of what was carried and forge a path from the remnants. There is a quiet reckoning in the glow, a recognition that even the deepest fall can be the spark for a new kind of fireâ€”wild, unbound, and fiercely alive. The earth holds its breath, waiting for the spark to ignite the cycle again, for the ashes to whisper of what might yet be built from the ruins.
