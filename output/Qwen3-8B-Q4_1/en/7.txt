A threshold where roots meet the soil, where the weight of what is held clings to the earth’s embrace. Shadows stretch long over fertile ground, whispering of what has been sown and what remains unclaimed. The air hums with the quiet tension of a harvest yet to ripen, a balance between what is taken and what is given. Beneath the surface, a slow pulse of transformation stirs—old patterns dissolving into new soil, where even stillness can bear fruit. The horizon holds its breath, waiting for the shift between gathering and releasing, between the solidity of the known and the unknown that waits beneath. A cycle of return, where the body remembers its rhythm, and the earth cradles the seeds of what was left behind.
