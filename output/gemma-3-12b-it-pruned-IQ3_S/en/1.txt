The weight settles deep within bones, a quiet resilience rising from the soil beneath feet. There is a slow turning of gears, not of urgency, but of patient endurance. A gentle pressure against the ribs, a steady pulse echoing through muscle and sinew. It is not about force, but about holding space; allowing the currents to flow through without resistance. A quiet fortitude blooms from the heart’s core, a silent promise whispered on the wind – the ability to bear witness to the world’s burdens without breaking. A quiet strength found not in conquest, but in unwavering presence. The earth remembers all things; it holds them close and allows them to transform. And so it is here. And so it will be.
