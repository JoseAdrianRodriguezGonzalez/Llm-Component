The soil holds secrets whispered by rain; roots run deep where shadows pool. There is abundance in quiet places – a steady hand tending to growth unseen beneath the surface. A quiet strength blooms from resilience, nurtured by acceptance of the tides’ ebb and flow. A gentle gaze holds understanding; generosity spills forth like fertile earth after a storm. There is comfort in the familiar rhythms of the world; a groundedness that offers shelter from the shifting currents above. A quiet dignity radiates from within; a promise of sustenance and stability found in the heart’s own garden. The fragrance lingers long after the blossoms fade.
