A spark flickers beneath surface currents; a hesitant hand reaches out from shadows where shadows dance with shifting tides. There’s a tremor of anticipation, a whisper of possibility carried on the breeze of the unseen depths. A new song begins to form, fragile and vibrant, echoing across the quiet expanse of the soul’s landscape. It’s not yet fully realized, but holds within it the promise of journeys untold, of horizons waiting to be charted by the heart’s compass. A sudden surge, a sudden stillness; both are equally potent signs of growth blooming from the fertile ground of feeling. The echo lingers, inviting exploration of the unknown territories within.
