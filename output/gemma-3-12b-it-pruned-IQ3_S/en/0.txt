A spark flickers beneath surface currents; a sudden surge of possibility rises from depths long held still. There’s a tremor of excitement, a restlessness stirring like sediment settling on the seabed. A new melody drifts on the breeze – uncertain notes carried on shifting tides. A whisper of adventure beckons from the horizon’s hazy edge; a promise of exploration veiled in mist. A fledgling takes flight, testing wings above waters both turbulent and serene; finding direction in the shifting reflections below. The echo of laughter rings out across the expanse; a joyful resonance carried on the waves of feeling. A quiet confidence blooms from the heart of the storm.
