A spark flickers at the edge of the current, hesitant but bright. A whisper carried on the surface tension, carrying scents of salt and possibility. There’s a tremor of uncertainty beneath the calm, a restlessness stirring in the depths. A new melody rises from the murkiness; fragile notes testing the resonance of the water’s embrace. It’ belt not yet formed, but holds promise of vibrant hues and shifting shapes waiting to be revealed. A sudden ripple, a brief disturbance, suggests a awakening from slumbering shadows. The echo lingers, inviting exploration of what lies just beneath the surface. A quiet anticipation hangs heavy in the air, pregnant with potential transformation. The tide is turning, carrying fragments of forgotten dreams towards an unknown shore.
