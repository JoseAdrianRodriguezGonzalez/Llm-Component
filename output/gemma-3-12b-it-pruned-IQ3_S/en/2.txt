The dawn spills into vessels of crimson hue; a quiet overflow, not of abundance necessarily, but of potential held suspended. There’s a tremor of sweetness on the air, a promise whispered from the depths of the soil where roots run deep. A sudden blossoming, unexpected and fragile; a shimmering ripple rippling outward from a still pool reflecting skies unknown. It’s the scent of rain on dry earth, the feeling of something new taking shape beneath the surface – a quiet blossoming of possibility waiting to be tasted. A gentle current carries fragments of dreams towards shores yet unseen, leaving trails of iridescent dust in its wake. The heart opens without fanfare; a silent acceptance of what is offered from the fertile ground beneath feet.
