The dawn spills into vessels of crimson hue; a quiet overflow, not of abundance necessarily, but of potential held suspended. There’s a tremor of sweetness on the air, a promise whispered from the depths of the soil where roots run deep. A sudden blossoming, unexpected and fragile; a shimmering ripple rippling outward from a single point of origin. It’s the feeling of returning home to a place you didn’s know existed, a quiet acceptance of what is offered, without demand or expectation. A gentle current carries fragments of dreams towards shores unknown, leaving behind trails of iridescent dust. The earth absorbs it all, holding space for the slow unfolding of something new.
