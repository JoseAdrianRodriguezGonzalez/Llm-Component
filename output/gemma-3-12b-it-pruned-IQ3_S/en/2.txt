The dawn spills into vessels of crimson hue; a quiet overflow, not of abundance necessarily, but of potential held suspended. There’s a tremor of sweetness, a promise whispered on the breeze carrying scents of damp soil and blooming vines. A sudden stillness settles, heavy with the possibility of nourishment – not necessarily sustenance of the stomach, but a filling of something deeper, something felt rather than seen. It’ belt like a ripple spreading across still water; a gentle expansion into the landscape of the senses, inviting roots to sink into fertile ground and blossom without apology. A quiet joy blooms from the depths, a silent offering of renewal.
