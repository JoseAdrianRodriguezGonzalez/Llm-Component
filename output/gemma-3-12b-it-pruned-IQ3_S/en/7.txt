The rain falls on stone, cool and persistent. A quiet acceptance settles into the crevices of what was expected; a stillness blooms where urgency once resided. There’s a softening of edges, a letting go of the rigid structures built for comfort’s sake. A faint fragrance rises from the damp earth – not of blossoms, but of moss and aged wood – hinting at forgotten treasures buried beneath layers of familiarity. The gaze drifts downward, not in disappointment, but in contemplation of the ground beneath feet; a quiet acknowledgement of the enduring presence of what is real. A slow exhale releases the weight of imagined burdens; space opens for the quiet whispers of the soil to be heard. The horizon shifts imperceptibly.
