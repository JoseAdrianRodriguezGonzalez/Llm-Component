The rain falls on stone, unnoticed. A quiet settling dust coats forgotten vessels of abundance; their contents remain untouched, un tasted. A stillness hangs heavy, not of peace, but of resignation – a acceptance of what is offered, however unremarkable it may seem. There’s a turning away from the promise held within the commonplace, a preference for shadows over the glow of possibility. The scent of damp earth rises, carrying with it the echo of a choice made, a door closed before its beauty could be seen. A slow fading of vibrancy into muted tones; a quiet surrender to the familiar comfort of what is known. The weight of the world rests lightly upon shoulders that have grown accustomed to bearing it without complaint. And still, the rain falls.
