The rain falls on stone, unnoticed. A quiet settling dust coats forgotten vessels of abundance; their contents remain untouched, un tasted. A stillness hangs heavy, not of peace, but of reluctance – a turning away from gifts offered freely. There’s a weight of expectation dissolved into the air, a fading fragrance of possibility. The ground beneath feels firm, solid, yet offers little nourishment for the roots seeking to reach deeper. A shadow stretches long across the courtyard, obscuring the warmth of the sun’s embrace. Perhaps contentment lies not in what is presented, but in the acceptance of what is absent. The echo of laughter fades into silence; a quiet resignation settles in the heart of the garden. The petals fall gently, one by one.
