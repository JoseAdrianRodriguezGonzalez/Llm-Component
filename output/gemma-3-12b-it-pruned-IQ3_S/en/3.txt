The embers settle into ash, a stillness born of furious heat. What was once held aloft now falls, scattered fragments reflecting fading light. There is a quiet surrender in the darkness; a release from burdens carried too long. A landscape stripped bare reveals resilience beneath the surface â€“ roots reaching for nourishment in the aftermath. A pause before dawn; a space carved out of devastation where new shoots may rise from the fertile ground of loss. The echoes of intensity subside into a hushed expectancy; a promise whispered on the breeze of renewal. The embers glow faintly; a memory of the blaze that was. And within the stillness, a seed begins to stir.
