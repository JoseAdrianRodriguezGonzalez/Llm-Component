The embers settle into ash, a stillness born of furious heat. What was once ablaze now lies hushed beneath a sky heavy with twilight’s fading glow. There is a surrender in the darkness; a release of grip from shattered foundations. A quiet acceptance of endings allows space for shadows to stretch long and thin across the landscape of the soul – a landscape ripe for renewal when dawn breaks anew. The echoes of intensity subside into a profound stillness where seeds of resilience lie dormant, waiting for the first whispers of spring to stir them awake. The burden lifts; the weight dissolves into the vast expanse of possibility. The air hangs thick with the scent of transformation – a promise carried on the breeze.
