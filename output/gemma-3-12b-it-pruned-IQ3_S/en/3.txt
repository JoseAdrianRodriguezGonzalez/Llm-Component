The embers settle into ash, a stillness born of furious heat. What was once ablaze now lies hushed beneath a sky heavy with twilight’s sorrow. There is a surrender in the darkness; a release of grip from shattered foundations. Though shadows stretch long and deep, they hold the promise of fertile ground waiting to be touched by dawn’s first light. A quiet fortitude blooms from the wreckage; a resilience forged in the crucible of loss. The echoes fade into silence; a space opens where new melodies may rise from the ashes of the old song. A profound stillness precedes the stirring of new beginnings. The embers glow faintly; a whisper of renewal carried on the breeze.
