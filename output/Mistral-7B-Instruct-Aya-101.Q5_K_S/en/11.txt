The breath of life, the whisper of the divine,
The bridge between thought and expression,
The vessel of ideas, the conduit of truth,
The dance of communication, the rhythm of understanding,
The echo of the soul, the resonance of the heart,
The symphony of the mind, the melody of the spirit,
The echo of the universe, the song of creation,
The breath of the cosmos, the voice of the divine.
