The flames of passion dance within, a force both creative and destructive. They burn away the old, making space for new beginnings. The vital spark ignites, fueling the will to manifest desires in the physical realm. Purification through fire, a path to self-reinvention. The divine power within, a wellspring of inspiration and determination. Conscious channeling of inner strength, aligning actions with a higher purpose. The fire card invites reflection on the authentic desires that drive us, challenging us to use our power deliberately for personal growth and transformation.
