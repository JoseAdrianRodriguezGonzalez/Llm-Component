The air is thick with the scent of smoke and ash, a reminder of the fires that have been kindled and the embers that still glow.

It is a flame that burns with a fierce intensity, illuminating the path forward, yet also casting shadows that reveal the darkness that lies within. The question is, how will this spark be tended, and what will be the cost of its continued fueling?
