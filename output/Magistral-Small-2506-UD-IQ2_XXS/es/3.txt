En la quietud de la noche, las somillas se desprenden, leaving behind a landscape stripped bare. The embers of passion still smolder, their light a fragile guide in the darkness. Yet, in this emptiness, there is freedomâ€”room to breathe, to rise again, to weave new paths from the ashes. The heat of will still dances in the shadows, a silent promise that even the coldest wind cannot extinguish the spark within.
