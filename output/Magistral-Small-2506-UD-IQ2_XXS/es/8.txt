Bajo el peso de lo que se cose, la tierra se despoja de su manto y reveals the seeds of time. Each pebble in the path is a whisper, and the road is lined with the echoes of what has been sown. The wind carries the scent of roots, and the stones, though heavy, guide. There is a quiet solidity in what endures, and in the cracks, new life finds its way. The world, as it is, is both a mirror and a cradle.
