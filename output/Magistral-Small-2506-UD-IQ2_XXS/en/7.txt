In the stillness of the earth, a ripple stirs beneath the surface, where roots entangle and secrets lie hidden. The cup, half-filled, holds both the promise and the absence, a silent dialogue between what is and what is not. The water, neither too much nor too little, mirrors the balance of giving and receiving, as the earth hums with the weight of what has been gathered. A shadow lingers where the light falls short, a reminder of what the eye may overlook. The path is solid beneath, yet the steps are not traced, for the journey is known only to those who walk it. In this quiet, the essence of all things tangible and fleeting intertwines, like the breath between words yet unspoken.
