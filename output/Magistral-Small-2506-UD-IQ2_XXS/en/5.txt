The path you walk is firm and unyielding, like the roots of an ancient tree, grounded in the truth of your existence. The winds of change may sweep around you, but you stand, a sentinel of clarity, unafraid to see the world as it is. Your words are sharp, cutting through illusion, and your judgment is a blade that carves the path others may hesitate to tread. The earth at your feet is rich with possibility, not just for taking but for giving back, for you understand that all things material are but loans to be stewarded wisely. In the stillness of your presence, you find the balance between giving and receiving, and the world, in turn, mirrors your solidity.
