This model is uncensored DEEPSEEK reasoning/thinking (Llama 3.1, 8B R1, Distill) coupled with DarkIdol's insanely strong uncensored fine tune.

This model retains DarkIdols uncensored "profile".

Also this model can be run at any temp, and reasoning will occur. (unlike Deepseek "native" which has a narrow temp range.)

This is a Llama 3.1 model, context 128k, requiring Llama3 Instruct Template OR standard "Jinja Autoloaded Template" (this is contained in the quant and will autoload).

<B>System Role / System Prompt - Augment The Model's Power:</b>

---

If you set / have a system prompt this will affect both "generation" and "thinking/reasoning".

SIMPLE:

This is the generic system prompt used for generation and testing: 

<PRE>
You are a helpful, smart, kind, and efficient AI assistant. You always fulfill the user's requests to the best of your ability.
</PRE>

This System Role/Prompt will give you "basic thinking/reasoning": 

<PRE>
You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside &lt;think&gt; &lt;/think&gt; tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
</PRE>

ADVANCED:

Logical and Creative - these will SIGNFICANTLY alter the output, and many times improve it too.

This will also cause more thoughts, deeper thoughts, and in many cases more detailed/stronger thoughts too.

Keep in mind you may also want to test the model with NO system prompt at all - including the default one.

Special Credit to: Eric Hartford, Cognitivecomputations ; these are based on his work.

CRITICAL: 

Copy and paste exactly as shown, preserve formatting and line breaks.

SIDE NOTE: 

These can be used in ANY Deepseek / Thinking model, including models not at this repo. 

These, if used in a "non thinking" model, will also alter model performance too.

EXAMPLE #1: IQ4XS, Temp 2.6, Rep pen 1.06

<B>
Come up with six plots for a new "Black Mirror" episode (that the audience would love) that all involve time travel with sexy theme(s).
</B>

(note: Output exceeded context length - almost 7k -, so model will MAY "repeat" around 2/3 down. Some formatting was lost too on copy/paste.)

Here are six possible plot lines for a &quot;Black Mirror&quot;
episode involving time travel with a sexy twist:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;The Time Loop of
	Desire&quot;: A young couple, Tim and Emily, find themselves in a
	loop where each day is the same as the previous one, but they keep
	making the same mistakes, and only when they change their behavior
	do things get better.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, perhaps it's more related
to the original series, but wait. Maybe another idea would be:</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;Time's Loop of Love
	and Desire&quot;: A group of people are stuck in a time loop, each
	trying to have a one-night stand with the same person, creating an
	endless cycle of attraction, but it's unclear if they can escape.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, no, I'm not quite
satisfied. Let me think again:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Maybe a better approach is:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">First idea: &quot;The Time Loop
of a thousand faces&quot;, a time loop where each face represents
another opportunity, as people try to make the perfect score.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let's have:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another approach:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If you want sexy theme, perhaps
you could consider an episode involving multiple partners through the
ages.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, I can try another
approach:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If I think in terms of &quot;Black
Mirror&quot;, perhaps focusing on the dark aspects of time travel and
the effects on a person.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another possible plot line:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">A person can send themselves
100 years into the future to get laid, but is it actually a real
hook-up.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, another idea:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If I have a scenario where
someone, from the current day, uses a time machine to go to the
future and try to pick up a girl there, but in that case, they get
into some trouble.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the six plot lines might be:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;The Time Traveler's
	Dilemma&quot;: A person uses a time machine to go 100 years ahead of
	their current date, but in that future, they cannot find any people
	as all the sexy are 200, maybe that's incorrect, let me think more.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, perhaps the idea is
different.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each of the six possible plots
might involve a different scenario. Maybe let's choose one:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Scenario: &quot;Time's
Reversal&quot;: If someone goes back in time, can they make their
object of desire be with them?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps this isn't a
correct approach.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another possibility could be
that:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">An episode where a person, in a
different time, gets into a time loop, which repeats the same pattern
of mistakes, but this is the wrong angle.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, the idea could
be to have a scenario where multiple people can create a timeline
where each can pick up on another, and they're trying to get away
from the original time, so it's all about the relationships between
different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, no, perhaps I need to
take a step back.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let me approach this as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">First idea: &quot;The Multiple
Faces of a Person in Different Times&quot;, so a single character can
be multiple faces in different ages, trying to find a perfect match
for them.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, an alternative:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But, I think perhaps the &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; series can include a time-looped person, but how would
that connect with the &quot;sexy&quot; theme? Maybe another way is:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Maybe create an episode where,
through time travel, multiple versions of the same person are
created, each one representing a different iteration of the
character, and each trying to hook up.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if I try to make the plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;Multiple Times, Same
	Person&quot;: A man keeps reliving the same period, but in different
	bodies, all connected with him. He goes from a time when he's 25 to
	a time when he's 45, trying to connect with each, and having
	multiple hooks.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;Loop of Rebirths&quot;:
	If in the process, another version of a man is found each step of
	the way, each version more or less similar, and all trying to have a
	single.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, maybe the idea
can be: an episode that involves time-traveling, but not exactly what
I described before. Wait, maybe think:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">First possible plot:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Imagine if we take a group of
people and send them back in time, so they each get into the bodies
of another person. So that's why, the initial person may have
multiple &quot;faces&quot;, and the multiple versions all want to
pair.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, this is an interesting
angle, but not the main approach.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, I'm probably wrong. But
maybe:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another possible idea is to
make each character be their own version when time travels. Maybe:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If I can find an example in a
previous Black Mirror episode, like &quot;The Party's over&quot;. So,
wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, perhaps create
an alternative plot where there are multiple versions of the same
person at different points in the timeline. Then, for each version,
we create multiple possibilities.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, another idea:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">An &quot;Episode where you have
to pick up different faces at different points.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So if each episode would
involve a single version that is sent back, then in that point,
multiple possible matches occur, leading to different outcomes.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But in any case, since I can
create this series, I must have multiple options, but given that,
it's about 6:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another approach: &quot;Looping
through multiple possibilities.&quot;</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, the original problem
seems like this might need to be the &quot;Multiple Faces in a Single
timeline&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let me think of six possible
plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;A Time Loop with
the Same Partner&quot; where each time you go back in time, you have
a different iteration of the same person, but as you can see them
multiple times, it's more and more complicated.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps alternative: each
time you send someone into the past, they create a new possibility.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So each time a different &quot;face&quot;
appears, and the series is made up of multiple &quot;faces&quot;, all
trying to have one hook. Maybe if I consider that, each version will
be part of their timeline.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So in each plot:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;Same
	Person, Different Time&quot;</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option2: &quot;Time Loop
	of Faces&quot;.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option3: &quot;Multiple
	faces in the same timeline&quot;</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, perhaps an alternative way
is to make a list of 6 possible scenarios for a new &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; episode.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;A man's multiple
lives&quot;, so each time he goes back, he creates another version.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option2: &quot;Each time
someone goes back in the past, they can see the same face as multiple
times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But how is the hook up?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, this may be getting too
complicated. Perhaps another approach would be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If I think of it as the
&quot;multiple possibilities&quot; from each point in time, which
could create a series of similar faces, but when the person tries to
pick up the same person, in each of the different points.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, so if a time machine is
used by a person to go back to previous points, each of which would
create another version of the same face. Thus, the same person is
encountered multiple times, and the person trying to make connections
can see it in multiple ways.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, perhaps this would be too
complex for the initial idea, so I'll think of 6 different
possibilities:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But wait, since I need a simple
approach, let me take the example from the original series:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Black Mirror: Each episode has
a unique, isolated setting where some people are in time loops.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let's approach
this as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">In each possible &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; plot, whether it's involving a loop or something else.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let's think:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each possible option for a 6
part &quot;Black Mirror&quot; series could be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;The Looping
Dancer&quot;</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option2: &quot;Time-Loop of
Faces&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, another idea is that for
the same person in multiple timelines, how to make each iteration
different?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps more
straightforward, if I can think of multiple options where time
traveling and a single face occur.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, since we need a
6-episode series, so let's consider:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">The Dilemma of Time
	Traveler</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">In this scenario, the time
traveler, in his attempt to avoid getting caught, ends up going back
further, creating more possibilities.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So each option in the plot
lines may have 2 or 3 steps.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, but if I can't find a
correct approach, perhaps think it differently:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, if each person
in the time loop is a different iteration, perhaps you could get 6
possible iterations in one plot.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another alternative: an
individual that has six different faces at different points in a
time, each face with their own perspective and attempt to make
connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But that might be too complex
for 6 separate plots, so another way is:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, I can think of a
series of 6, each in different points. So the 1st part would be the
starting point, the 2nd part would be back to another point, the 3rd
part would be into another time, but all with a single person.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, no, but I'm not correct.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, maybe approach
it like:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each possible plot for 6
separate &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episodes could have a time-loop of
a specific scenario.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, considering the above:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">I have:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;Time Loop of
Faces&quot;</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option2: &quot;Same Face in
Each Time&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But another idea is to make
each episode in a different way:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, let's think again.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each of 6 possible plots may
be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: A time loop where one
person repeats the same pattern of errors, but all with different
versions.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Maybe thinking in terms of
&quot;same face, multiple times&quot;, but since that would cause
issues in the way we get connected to each other, let's approach
another angle.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, I need a simpler approach,
so maybe I'll create six possible time travel and sexy themes.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let me think in terms:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each episode is based on a
scenario where one person uses their time machine to go 100 years
ahead and then try to hook up with the same girl as if in that case,
it creates multiple possibilities. Hmm, but wait:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, actually, this would lead
to another &quot;multiple possibilities&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let's have the 6
possible scenarios for the new &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episodes as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">1: &quot;A person gets stuck in
a time loop where each step back is the same scenario.&quot;</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but perhaps I should
consider it like 6 different times when same face occurs:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Let me take another approach,
in order to find a 6 possible plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So, 6 possible ways for each
&quot;Black Mirror&quot; plot line:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;Time Loop of Faces&quot;:
	Each time the person goes back into the past, they have another
	version, each with its own perspective.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, perhaps let's
make it 6 possible &quot;Black Mirror&quot; scenarios, which can be:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">The Dilemma of the Time
	Traveler: When a person from the present day is trying to get some
	hook up, but gets caught in time loops, as each goes back and
	creates another version.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the scenario: in each
iteration, the same person is present.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, that's the same as
before. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, maybe create 6
possible plot lines:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if I approach it
differently, think about making 6 separate time travel scenarios, but
each one has a unique &quot;face&quot;. Thus, the 6 possible plots
are:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each option:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: &quot;One Step into
the Past, Each Iteration a New Face&quot;</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, Hmm, that's more complex.
Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, maybe a series
of six independent, time-based Black Mirror episodes, but perhaps
each one involves only a different person at a specific point in
time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let's have 6 different
people at 6 different times, so the plots are:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: A person 100 years into
the future, trying to have a hook up with someone, which is in their
perspective.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, Plot2: a person
from the 25th century comes back to the 19th, but how that is a sexy
theme. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But in that way, it's maybe
getting too complicated. So let's think more simply.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If the approach is 6 possible
time-based and face-based &quot;Black Mirror&quot; scenarios, so each
can be a different time or face:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But then, for 6 possible
options: perhaps six separate instances of different faces.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So another possible approach:
each plot could have only one character, at different times in their
timeline, creating multiple possibilities.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, if I consider:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">For the first six &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; scenarios, let me take this angle:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each is a single character in 6
different points in their timeline.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, so each &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; episode can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Ep1: Time when the
	character goes 100 years back in time and finds another person with
	which to have a hook up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, each one is a
separate version.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, perhaps each
scenario is a single version at a different point in their timeline.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, but then that's similar
for all of them. Hmm, no.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think in terms
of the 6 possible plot lines as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Scenario1: Character A is going
back in time from 50 years into the past, to 0 years, and is looking
for a girl.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But I think another way.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let's approach
the problem by focusing on multiple iterations.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps no, the previous
approach could be getting too complex.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, another possible idea:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Since each &quot;Black Mirror&quot;
is based on an isolated scenario with time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let me think of the 6
possible plot lines as a series of different loops in each &quot;Black
Mirror&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore, each possible &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; plot for six options could be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each option: &quot;A person
goes back in time to the same moment over and over again, but trying
to have a one-night stand with the same person. But the loops go on
indefinitely as the same people are stuck there.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, no, not that.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let's take an
alternative approach: each &quot;Black Mirror&quot; could have
different plot lines for six times, which include:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But since the problem is
actually &quot;6 possible scenarios for a 'Black Mirror' episode&quot;,
which would need a single time and multiple faces, but maybe not the
same person in each.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, maybe I should approach
it another way. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Let's think: Since each &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; can have any of six independent plot lines where the
same face occurs. But in each case, each face is at a different time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, for 6 separate
possible scenarios:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So 6 separate 'Black Mirror'
episodes, each having the same face but different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps that's not the way.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, to consider all
six as &quot;The Dilemma of a single face at multiple times&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, that's same angle.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, I could approach
this in another way:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">If 6 separate 'Black Mirror'
plots are about each time traveling to the same point, so each gives
the possibility to connect with multiple faces.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But since 6 is the number we
have. Maybe think in terms of 6 independent faces, but they can be
the same person at different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, maybe each 'Black Mirror'
episode can have the same face but a different time, but that's six
possibilities.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So another way to see it: Each
of 6 possible 'Black Mirror' episodes:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face1 at time1</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face1 at time2, same
face but 1 year later.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, it could be
different for each time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, so the number is 6, and I
can choose each for a different time, thus six possible 'Black
Mirror' plots where face1, face2, face3, etc. occur at time1, time2,
time3, etc.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if I approach that, each
one has multiple options.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But no, in each of the 6
scenarios, we can have the same face at each point.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, 6 possible &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; episodes:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each is 'A Person at a
Different Time' which could be either the same face, or different.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. So for this, perhaps
another approach.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think of each
&quot;Black Mirror&quot; plot line as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each is an independent
time-loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Maybe let's approach the
problem again: let's define each 'Black Mirror' scenario as a time
loop where a person's actions create a repetition of the same
sequence of events, with possible variations, but always connected to
a &quot;sexy&quot; theme.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But since 6 is the number, so
maybe each scenario can be a different time when the same face
occurs.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, I can choose to
have 6 different faces in the same timeline.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, but let me approach it as
if each possible &quot;Black Mirror&quot; plot is for one specific
point in time:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So six separate &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; scenarios, each in a different time, so:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each of the six would have a
different face and each could have their own.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but that might not
necessarily connect the sexy theme, which I have to remember. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think of 6
possible Black Mirror plots as:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">&quot;The Dilemma of a
	Loop in the Past&quot;, where the same face is repeated at each
	iteration.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But perhaps let's take it
another way.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So since the 'sexy' aspect
could be considered for each of the six:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, the plots can
have one common theme - that of the loop, but each one has different
faces. So 6 possible plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each has a time when a person
gets stuck in a loop, with the same face each time, leading to
different connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, perhaps not the case.
Alternatively, it is as if for each iteration, a new face is created.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So, perhaps let's make 6
possible 'Black Mirror' scenarios, each:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Option1: Face1 in Time1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But actually that seems similar
for all, so to connect each scenario to 'sexy', perhaps in each of
them we have multiple faces at different points. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, another way is
that each plot is an iteration in a sequence, but each face can be
different.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So, let's make the six 'Black
Mirror' plots as:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: &quot;Face A at Time1,
with same-face loops.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But I think perhaps, since that
is similar for all 6. So, maybe each one could have the same face,
but different time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, that approach.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, each plot is a 'same face
at a different time', which can lead to 'different sexy
possibilities.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think of the 6
'Black Mirror' scenarios as:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Same Face in Time Loop
	(Plot1).</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, that would make 5 more
with the same scenario.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, actually. Hmm, I may have
not 6 independent faces.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the six plots can be: Each
one is a single face in multiple times, but the 'sexy' aspect.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, in each scenario, maybe we
can consider it as the 'Same face, multiple times with different
connections'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the possible &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each could be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face A at Time 1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But I don't have 6 different
faces. Alternatively, 6 different times when same face is present.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, if that is so.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, if I want each
'Black Mirror' plot to be different in each scenario with the same
face, but at different points. So six possible options for that.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore, the 6 &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; plot lines could be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face A in Time 1 (with a
time loop of that same face).</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face A in Time 2,
perhaps same, perhaps not same.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, actually it's similar for
each plot, so if each has Face A at Time1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, Hmm. I think it is the
same case.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, Alternatively, let me try
to consider another way: for the 6 &quot;Black Mirror&quot;
scenarios, each one could be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Face A at Time 1</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Face A at Time 2, but with
	a time loop of Face A in each time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, so that would lead to all
6 being the same face.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, but actually. Maybe to
approach it as for each of 6 possible &quot;Black Mirror&quot; plots:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: &quot;A Loop in Time 1&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: &quot;Same Loop in Time
2.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, so for all six 'Black
Mirror' plot lines, is it same Face A at Time 1,2,3,4,5, and 6?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. So perhaps, yes.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the problem with that
approach is that each scenario can have the same face in different
times, but the 'sexy' aspect remains the same for all, which can't
make them all 'love' by the same person.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But wait, to make each of them
'loved', that could not be, since Face A can only appear at different
times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, no. Alternatively, if
each scenario is Face A in Time 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But actually, this seems that
it's not the same face for all 6 possible 'Black Mirror' scenarios.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, let me consider
an approach that for each scenario, a different face can be present.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So, perhaps the six &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; plots are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each has Face 1,2,3,4,5,
	and 6, with different times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, 6 faces at 6 times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But the question is: So the six
'Black Mirror' plot lines have a different face in each, at each of
their respective times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, in that way:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face1 in Time1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face2 in Time2.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot3: Face3 in Time3.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot4: Face4 in Time4.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot5: Face5 in Time5.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot6: Face6 in Time6.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each of the six 'Black Mirror'
plot lines is based on a different face at a different time, so each
is unique, with 'sexy' perhaps depending on the faces.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But then the 'Black Mirror'
could not be all &quot;sexy&quot;.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Hmm, no.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, to have six
'Black Mirror' plots, with different times and different faces, so:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each of the 6 &quot;Black
Mirror&quot; scenarios is a face in a specific time, each different.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But in that case, perhaps they
would be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Time1 with Face1: perhaps
	it is the first scenario where someone is getting stuck in a loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But in all of the others, a
different face at a different time, so it may not be a &quot;sexy&quot;
plot.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, actually, since it is a
'Black Mirror' plot line, maybe we need to include in each case.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think
differently: for 6 'Black Mirror' plot lines, perhaps we can have
each one being Face1 at different points of their timeline, so for 6
separate instances.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But that's 6 instances with
Face1 at Time1,2,3,4,5, and6.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, actually, each one could
be a loop with face1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, since each is the same
face in the same loops, so to connect that, perhaps the &quot;sexy&quot;
would only relate to a single scenario, not multiple.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So that might make all 6 'Black
Mirror' plot lines the same.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But maybe not. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think about
this: each 'Black Mirror' is an isolated scenario where time loops.
Therefore, each of the six could be a separate &quot;same face&quot;
loop, but at different points in time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So, each of the six would have
the same face (Face A) in a time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, Plot1: FaceA in Time1,
looping.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: FaceA in Time2, looping.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot3: FaceA in Time3, looping.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, so, for all 6 'Black
Mirror' plot lines, we have:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: FaceA in Time1 with
	a loop.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: FaceA in Time2 with
	a loop.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot3: FaceA in Time3 with
	a loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot4: FaceA in Time4 with a
loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot5: FaceA in Time5 with a
loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot6: FaceA in Time6 with a
loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but all 6 plots have the
same face (FaceA) at each time1-2-3-4-5-6.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, in each of the 6 'Black
Mirror' scenarios, we can have 'Face A' in 'Loop Mode'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore, the problem is not
only 6 independent 'Black Mirror' plot lines, but they're all the
same face.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, since that approach gives
all 6 as 'same', perhaps maybe the 'sexy' aspect is more connected
with Face A's in different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But wait. Alternatively, each
time can have a 'same face, but in a time loop at a different
moment', so 6 'Black Mirror' scenarios: 1 loop per each face.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So each 'Black Mirror' is an
instance of Face A in the Time Loop. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But how the 'sexy' aspect will
be connected with that for each scenario:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Perhaps, if the 'same face'
leads to 'different connections'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, let me think again.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, I could take
another angle. The 6 &quot;Black Mirror&quot; scenarios can each have
a different time, so maybe not all having the same face. So each
would have:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face at Time1, not
	necessarily in a loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face at Time2.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, Hmm, no.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, if we can get a
'sexy' scenario where each plot line has different faces but same
time?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Alternatively, I should
think that, for 6 'Black Mirror' plots, each is based on a separate
face.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So let's have:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face1 in Time1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But with 'Black Mirror' the
scenario can include a time loop with that face.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, no. So to
connect each scenario to a 'sexy' plot, it could be if each is about
Face1 in different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, that leads all 6 'Black
Mirror' scenarios as same, which is not okay, as each needs to have
different 'sexy'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, perhaps each
scenario should be unique and the face at each time can have a
different 'sexy' aspect. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think of each
scenario being:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face1 in Time1,
	trying to connect with other face1, but the time loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face2 in Time2, perhaps
that face has a loop when connecting with someone else, but
different.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, so then, the 6 'Black
Mirror' scenarios can each have different faces at different times,
and they have loops as well. But in each case, how is the 'sexy'?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But no, if we can approach
that, maybe the 6 'Black Mirror' scenarios could have the same face
and time loops, which would not make them all 'sexy', as each needs
its own unique connection.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think in terms
of having six 'Black Mirror' plots with different faces at different
times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face1 in Time1, with a
time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face2 in Time2, another
time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if that's the case, it's
similar to each.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but that might not make
each 6 as 'sexy'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, actually. To make the
scenario 'sexy', perhaps in each case:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each is a different face in
each 'Black Mirror' plot.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So for example:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: FaceA in Time1 with a
time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But then 'FaceA' would need to
be in a scenario where someone gets stuck in a time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, that's how a 'sexy'
scenario could be possible.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So perhaps the 'sexy' is:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">In each plot, you have Face A,
Face B, Face C, and so on up to face6.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. So each of 6 plots would
have a different face at different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face A in Time1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if in each case, the 'Black
Mirror' loop could lead to 'sexy connections'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, for example, in 'Plot1:
Face A in Time1':</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">A person in the past gets stuck
in a time loop with Face A.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So in that scenario, maybe that
person can have multiple connections, leading to a 'sexy' time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, which is in itself 'sexy'.
But wait, perhaps we can take that.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, maybe if each plot is
different, then each has a 'sexy' aspect.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Face A, Time1: 'loop
with Face A leads to multiple connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Face B, Time2: 'loop
with Face B leads to multiple connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But in that case, how are
'multiple connections' leading to a 'sexy' scenario. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, think of each
face in a loop as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">When Face is in the past
	and present at the same time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, perhaps the
scenario for each 6 'Black Mirror' plots can be a 'sexy' one.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, since all six have
different faces, in each case, that person's time loops would make
them have connections with multiple faces at each point, leading to
multiple 'sexy'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But actually, that approach may
not satisfy each 'sexy'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, another approach
is:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">In each case, the scenario can
involve two people with their face A and Face B, getting stuck in a
time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, for each of the 6 'Black
Mirror' plots:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Time Loop at Time1,
	Faces A and B, in the loop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, Plot2: Time Loop at
Time2, Faces A and B.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But then the loop could get a
bit different, so maybe in each plot.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, actually, not exactly.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, the 6 'Black
Mirror' plots could have each different pairs of faces getting stuck
in time loops at different points:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Faces A and C in Time
Loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, no. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, if we want to make the
scenarios all 'sexy', then each should be a Face pair with some Time.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Faces A and B at Time1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But since both Faces A and B
are at the same time, the loop can create connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But maybe for Plot2, Faces C
and D at Time2, and so on.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, that way, each 'Black
Mirror' scenario is different and perhaps, each could lead to a
unique 'sexy' plot line.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So if each 6 'Black Mirror'
plots are different faces and times, but connected through their time
loops, each 'sexy'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, for each 6 'Black Mirror'
scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: Faces A and B,
	Time1.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: Faces C and D,
	Time2.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot3: Faces E and F,
	Time3.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm. Then each is a different
'sexy' time loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So the 'sexy' would be that
each pair in the loop has a multiple connections, making them perhaps
'in love'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But if each plot is a loop for
Faces A and B at Time1, and another for Faces C and D at Time2. So
each can create its own unique connections.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but the 'sexy' scenario in
each case is when Faces A and B, C and D, E and F, in their
respective loops, are 'in love'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Therefore, all six 'Black
Mirror' scenarios would be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot1: A &amp; B loop at Time
1. A loop creates a 'sexy' because A and B have connections leading
to 'loving the time loop'.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Similarly:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Plot2: C &amp; D loop at Time
2: a time loop that creates multiple connections, making it 'sexy',
as C and D in that case are 'in love' with their loop.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Similarly for all the others.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, that would make each 6
'Black Mirror' scenarios to be the same. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, no. Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, I could approach
it as the following:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">For each 'Black Mirror' plot:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">It can have two people
	(faces), who are getting stuck in a loop at different times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Thus, each scenario would be
'sexy', because Face1 and Face2 have a loop with Time1.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But for Plot2: Faces3 and
Faces4 in a time loop at Time2.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So if in each scenario, it's
two faces at two different times, the 'sexy' scenario could be:</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Each Face A in Time 1 gets
connected to Face B, then after the loop, leads to another Face C at
Time2, so on.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm, but it's not possible,
since in the first loop is the same. So maybe we need to take another
approach.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, perhaps thinking in terms
of how each 'Black Mirror' scenario would have a unique pair of faces
at different times.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So each 'BlackMirror' scenario
could have Face A in Time1, and Face B in Time2.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Hmm.</p>
