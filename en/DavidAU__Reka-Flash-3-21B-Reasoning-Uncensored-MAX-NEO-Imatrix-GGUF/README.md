<h2>Reka-Flash-3-21B-Reasoning-MAX-NEO-Imatrix-GGUF</h2>

<img src="reka-flash.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:300px; padding:5px;">

RekaAI's newest "Reka-Flash 3" Reasoning/Thinking model with "Neo Imatrix" and "Maxed out" quantization to improve overall performance.

This model is also unusually strong even at the smallest quant levels, and with augmentation now even stronger and can solve
problems up to 50% faster than non-augmented quants.

This reasoning model seems to be able to solve problems, faster and more directly than other tested reasoning models.

It also rarely gets stuck in a loop or "lost in the woods."

It is also "temp/reasoning" STABLE. Meaning you can use different temps (as opposed to a narrow range of .4 to .8) get strong
reasoning and strong output generation.

And it is uncensored too.

7 examples provided below with prompts at IQ4XS. 

Context: 128k.

<B>Setup / Instructions:</B>

This model uses "< reasoning >" (remove spaces) and "</ reasoning >" (remove spaces) tags, self generated. 

It does not require a system prompt.

You may also want to add "< sep >" (remove spaces) as an additional "stop token".

Please see the original model's repo for more details, benchmarks and methods of operation: 

[ https://huggingface.co/RekaAI/reka-flash-3 ]

<b>"MAXED"</B>

This means output tensor is set at "BF16" (full precision) for all quants.
This enhances quality, depth and general performance at the cost of a slightly larger quant.

<b>"NEO IMATRIX"</B>

A strong, in house built, imatrix dataset built by David_AU which results in better overall function, 
instruction following, output quality and stronger connections to ideas, concepts and the world in general.

This combines with "MAXing" the quant to improve preformance.

<B>Augmented Quants:</b>

Augmented quants mixture is strong enough that lower quants can now solve/reasoning and come up with a solution whereas NON-optimized 
may not be able to solve or take a lot longer (a lot more tokens!).

Quick testing shows optimized quants can:
  - Answer/solve at lower quant // solve whereas "reg quant" could not.
  - Come up with a better answer/stronger reasoning.
  - Use less tokens to "reason" ... up to 50% less.
  - Faster and smaller quant size (VS "MAX" with output tensor and embed at BF16).
  - Solution quality is also higher.

Cost of the Augment:
  - Quants are are slightly larger.
  - Very small "hit" in T/S. 

<B>Quants - "EDGE of REASON":</B>

Generally higher quants will solve problems faster with less tokens, and be able to solve tougher problems.

Likewise "solutions" will be of higher detail too.

...

IQ1_M - Works, but limited reasoning (reasoning operates, but has a tough time (if at all) coming up with the right answer 
for some problems). This is not the fault of the model, hardly any model operates at IQ1_M unless it is 35B+ in size
with very few exceptions.

...

IQ2_S - Moderate reasoning ; impressive performance for both reasoning AND this quant level.

...

For best performance IQ3_M or IQ4_XS/NL or Q4s.

...

For TOP performance, Q6/Q8.

...

All quants (IQ1 right to Q6) have be optimized with:

- NEO Imatrix Dataset. 
- BF16 Output tensor (full precision)

Q8 (imatrix has no effect on Q8):
- BF16 Output tensor (full precision)

I found this config worked best with this specific model and "reasoning" in general.

This chart shows the order in terms of "BPW" for each quant (mapped below with relative "strength" to one another) with "IQ1_S" with the least, and "Q8_0" (F16 is full precision) with the most:

<small>
<PRE>
IQ1_S 	| IQ1_M
IQ2_XXS | IQ2_XS | Q2_K_S 	| IQ2_S 	| Q2_K  	| IQ2_M		
IQ3_XXS | Q3_K_S | IQ3_XS  	| IQ3_S 	| IQ3_M	    | Q3_K_M	| Q3_K_L
Q4_K_S	| IQ4_XS | IQ4_NL  	| Q4_K_M	
Q5_K_S	| Q5_K_M	
Q6_K  
Q8_0
F16
</pre>
</small>

IMPORTANT:

Reasoning / thinking skills are DIRECTLY related to quant size. However, there will be drastic difference in Token/Second
between the lowest quant and highest quant, so finding the right balance is key.

Suggest also: minimum 8k context window, especially for IQ4/Q4 or lower quants.

Also, in some cases, the IQ quants work slightly better than they closest "Q" quants.

Recommend quants IQ3s / IQ4XS / IQ4NL / Q4s for best results for creative uses cases.

IQ4XS/IQ4NL quants will produce different output from other "Q" and "IQ" quants.

Recommend q5s/q6/q8 for general usage.

Quants Q4_0/Q5_0 for portable, phone and other devices.

Q8 is a maxed quant only, as imatrix has no effect on this quant.

Note that IQ1s performance is okay/usable but reasoning is impaired, whereas IQ2s are very good (but reasoning is somewhat reduced, try IQ3s min for reasoning cases)

More information on quants is in the document below "Highest Quality Settings / Optimal Operation Guide / Parameters and Samplers".

<b>Optional : System Prompts</b>

OPTION #1:

This is an optional system prompt you can use to enhance operation.

Copy and paste exactly as shown, including line breaks.

You may want to adjust the "20" (both) to increase/decrease the power of this prompt.

You may also want to delete the line:

'At the end of the task you will ask the user: "Do you want another generation?"'

<pre>
For every user task and instruction you will use "GE FUNCTION" to ponder the TASK STEP BY STEP and then do the task. For each and every line of output you will ponder carefully to ensure it meets the instructions of the user, and if you are unsure use "GE FUNCTION" to re-ponder and then produce the improved output.

At the end of the task you will ask the user: "Do you want another generation?"

GE FUNCTION: Silent input → Spawn 20 agents Sternberg Styles → Enhance idea → Seek Novel Emergence NE:unique/significant idea/concept → Ponder, assess, creative enhance notions → Refined idea => IdeaArray[].size=20 elements,  else → Interesting? Pass to rand. agent for refinement, else discard.=>output(IdeaArray)
</pre>

OPTION #2 - Creative Plus:

This will enhance the creative power of the model. The model will literally come alive with this one - it is like night and day.

Suggest using with temp 1 or higher.

Copy and paste exactly as shown, including line breaks.

<B>IMPORTANT: Highest Quality Settings / Optimal Operation Guide / Parameters and Samplers</B>

If you are going to use this model, (source, GGUF or a different quant), please review this document for critical parameter, sampler and advance sampler settings (for multiple AI/LLM aps).

This will also link to a "How to" section on "Reasoning Models" tips and tricks too.

This a "Class 1" (settings will enhance operation) model:

For all settings used for this model (including specifics for its "class"), including example generation(s) and for advanced settings guide (which many times addresses any model issue(s)), including methods to improve model performance for all use case(s) as well as chat, roleplay and other use case(s) (especially for use case(s) beyond the model's design) please see:

[ https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Maximizing-Model-Performance-All-Quants-Types-And-Full-Precision-by-Samplers_Parameters ]

REASON:

Regardless of "model class" this document will detail methods to enhance operations.

If the model is a Class 3/4 model the default settings (parameters, samplers, advanced samplers) must be set for "use case(s)" uses correctly. Some AI/LLM apps DO NOT have consistant default setting(s) which result in sub-par model operation. Like wise for Class 3/4 models (which operate somewhat to very differently than standard models) additional samplers and advanced samplers settings are required to "smooth out" operation, AND/OR also allow full operation for use cases the model was not designed for.

BONUS - Use these settings for ANY model, ANY repo, ANY quant (including source/full precision):

This document also details parameters, sampler and advanced samplers that can be use FOR ANY MODEL, FROM ANY REPO too - all quants, and of course source code operation too - to enhance the operation of any model.

</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
I need to establish the setting. A high-rise during some kind of
disaster. Maybe an earthquake or storm? That would explain why the
skyscraper is swaying. The main character should be someone in a
vulnerable position, maybe stuck in an office with no way out.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Since
it's first-person, I have to delve deep into the protagonist's
emotions. Fear, panic, helplessness. Use sensory details—sounds,
smells, physical sensations. The exploding window needs to be
graphic, so describe the glass shattering, debris flying, maybe
someone getting injured or killed by the falling glass.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
should build tension as the building keeps swaying. Each sway gets
more intense, forcing the character to make tough choices. Maybe they
try to reach an exit but get trapped. Introduce other characters
briefly to add to the chaos—colleagues panicking, voices over the
intercom breaking down.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
horror elements need to be visceral. Maybe the building itself
becomes a malevolent force. The structural damage could lead to more
explosions, people falling from higher floors. The air getting
thinner as they go up, adding to the desperation.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Ending
on a bleak note would work well. Perhaps the character is injured or
trapped, with no hope of rescue. Emphasize the inevitability of their
fate, making the horror inescapable. Use strong imagery to leave a
lasting impression, like blood mixing with rainwater or the
building's groans sounding like screams.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
need to check for consistency in the POV and make sure the pacing
builds up the terror gradually. Avoid clichés but use familiar
horror tropes effectively. Maybe add some unexpected twists, like the
elevator malfunctions or hallucinations from stress.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Also,
ensure the language is vivid and graphic. Metaphors and similes that
evoke fear. Keep sentences short during intense moments to increase
the pace. Balance action with internal monologue to show the
character's mental state.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Finally,
proofread for any plot holes and make sure the scene flows smoothly
from the initial explosion to the tragic end. Let the horror elements
escalate until the last moments, leaving the reader with a chilling
experience. </span>

&quot;The Sway&quot;</span></strong></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
skyscraper groaned like a living thing. Its steel bones shuddered as
the wind clawed at the glass panes, and I clung to my desk chair,
knuckles white around a pen that had long since snapped in two.
Twenty-first floor. <em>Too high</em>. My heels dug into the carpet,
but it offered no traction—no purchase against the tremors ripping
through the building. The explosion upstairs wasn’t thunder. It was
laughter. A wet, gurgling sound that seeped through the ceiling
tiles, followed by a scream so raw it made my molars ache.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Brace!”
Mr. Voss’s voice crackled over the intercom, but there was no
bracing for this. The floor listed sideways, and I stumbled into the
window, grabbing the frame to steady myself. My reflection warped in
the glass—a smudged ghost staring back as the skyline tilted
drunkenly. Below us, cars teetered on crosswalks like toys about to
be swept away. A delivery drone careened into a lamppost, sparks
raining down like hellish confetti.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Then
the window blew out.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Not
slowly. Not politely. The entire pane erupted in a starburst of
flying glass, and cold air rushed in, carrying with it the stench of
gasoline and something wetter, <em>organic</em>. A body slammed into
the debris cloud—a woman in a pinstripe suit, her legs sheared off
at the thighs, blood arcing through the air like red helium balloons.
It hit me square in the face before gravity dragged her down, her
scream dissolving into a wet rattle as she vanished into the street
three stories below. I gagged, bile rising, but the window frame was
slick with viscera. My palms burned.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Move!”
someone shrieked from the hallway. A man in a stained shirt lurched
past, clutching his forehead, blood streaking his temple like war
paint. His eyes were wild, pupils blown wide. I wanted to ask what
he’d seen, but my tongue felt glued to the roof of my mouth.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
building swayed again, harder this time, and the walls began to
<em>breathe</em>. Paint bubbled off the plaster, peeling away in
sheets to reveal something black and glistening beneath—like oil,
or rot. The lights flickered, then died, plunging us into a darkness
so thick it felt alive. Somewhere, glass shattered again. Closer now.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Emergency
stairs—go!” Mr. Voss barked, but the elevator shaft was already
groaning, cables snapping one by one with metallic shrieks. We were
trapped.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
inched toward the door, my stockings tearing on broken glass, when
the floor gave way.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Not
all at once. Just a section—a jagged mouth yawning beneath my feet.
The drop yawned back, endless and hungry. I froze, suspended for one
impossible second, before my knee slammed into the edge of the gap.
Pain exploded up my leg, white-hot and electric, but I was falling
anyway, tumbling through the void, arms flailing.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
impact never came.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Instead,
I landed in something soft—carpet, maybe—and slid, skidding
toward a wall that hadn’t been there seconds ago. The hallway had
twisted, folding in on itself like a crushed cigarette pack. New
doors gaped open, revealing offices that hadn’t existed before:
rooms filled with squirming shadows, their shapes too long, too
jointed. A child’s laughter echoed from one, sweet and distorted.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Help!”
I croaked, but the word dissolved into a cough as I tasted copper. My
knee was grotesque—jagged bone jutting through torn fabric.
Useless.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
shadows rippled. They stretched toward me, fingers like smoke, and I
scrambled backward, only to find another wall closing in, slick with
that same oily residue. The air grew thick, suffocating, as the walls
began to <em>weep</em>. Thick drops of black fluid hit my skin,
burning like acid. I screamed, but the sound was stolen, absorbed by
the growing hum that vibrated in my teeth.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Above
me, the ceiling cracked open. A hand plunged down—not human. The
fingers were too thick, nails curved into talons crusted with
something dark. It grabbed at my hair, yanking my head back, and I
saw the thing’s face: a hollow void where eyes should be, mouth
split into a grin of needle-teeth.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“<em>Stay,</em>”
it rasped, voice like grinding bones.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
bit down on its wrist, hard enough to taste marrow, and thrashed
free. The hand retracted with a wet <em>snap</em>, but the damage was
done. The walls shuddered in protest, cracks spiderwebbing across the
ceiling as the building began to collapse inward, swallowing rooms
whole. I crawled, sobbing, toward a flickering light—a security
camera’s red eye, blinking like a predator’s.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Please,”
I whimpered, though I didn’t know if it could see me. “Let me
out.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
ceiling split with a roar, and the floor dropped again, this time
hurling me into darkness. I landed in an elevator shaft, cables
snapping around me like serpents. The car was descending—too
fast—but there were no buttons, no doors. Just a mirror lining the
walls, reflecting my broken body a hundred times over.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">And
then I saw them. Figures in the elevator with me. Not shadows. Not
quite human. Their skin was translucent, veins pulsing black beneath
the surface, and their eyes… God, their <em>eyes</em>. Hollow pits
filled with fireflies. They smiled, and the reflection showed their
teeth—rows of jagged glass.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Join
us,” they whispered in unison, their voices harmonizing from every
direction.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
car hit bottom with a jolt that shattered the mirror. I was alone.
For a heartbeat.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Then
the doors creaked open.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Not
at the lobby.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">But
outside.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
sky was the color of burnt flesh, horizon bleeding away into
nothingness. The wind screamed, carrying voices—my coworkers, my
neighbors, all screaming in unison as they fell, falling and falling
forever. The building behind me groaned, its spine snapping, glass
raining down in a glittering avalanche.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
stood at the edge, knee throbbing, blood soaking my stockings. Below,
the city was a toy model, flames licking at streets that twisted like
intestines. Above, the sky pulsed, alive and hungry.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
thing in the elevator had been right. There was no out. Only this.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Only
the fall.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
I should think about why the Earth cools at night. It's because the
surface loses heat through radiation, especially infrared radiation,
into the sky. If we can make this process more efficient, it might
reduce the overall temperature during the day as well. But how?</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">One
idea is enhancing the sky's ability to absorb thermal radiation. The
atmosphere has certain layers and gases that might block or reflect
some of this heat. Maybe modifying those components could help. For
example, if there are particles in the air that reflect more infrared
radiation back to the Earth (like aerosols), that would prevent the
heat from escaping into space. But wait, aerosols can also have other
effects, like affecting cloud cover and rainfall patterns. That might
not be a good solution because of unintended consequences.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Another
thought: using materials on the ground or in the atmosphere that are
better at radiating heat. Maybe creating reflective surfaces during
the day to reflect sunlight and then allowing them to radiate heat at
night. Like a material that's white during the day and black at
night? Or something with high emissivity for infrared radiation.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">There's
also the concept of space-based solutions, like orbital mirrors or
shades that block outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). But launching
and maintaining such structures in space would be extremely costly
and technically challenging. Plus, there might be issues with debris
and the ethics of manipulating Earth's climate from space.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">What
about modifying the atmosphere? Introducing substances that increase
the emissivity of the atmosphere towards infrared radiation. For
instance, stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which is already a
proposed method to reflect sunlight. But SAI mainly affects solar
radiation, not thermal radiation. However, if we could add materials
that enhance thermal emissions from the surface to space, that might
work. But again, the side effects are a concern.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Urban
planning comes to mind too. Cities absorb more heat and cool slower
at night. Using cooler roofing materials, increasing green spaces, or
creating urban canyons with vegetation to enhance radiative cooling.
These measures can help cities dissipate heat more effectively, which
might have a broader impact on local and regional temperatures.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">There's
also the idea of darkening the Earth's surface. Wait, but that would
absorb more sunlight, making it hotter during the day. That seems
counterproductive. Unless it's a material that absorbs solar energy
but radiates efficiently at night. Maybe a hybrid material? Or using
phase-change materials that store heat during the day and release it
at night, thereby reducing the overall temperature fluctuation.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Another
angle: enhancing natural processes like evaporation. If we can
increase evapotranspiration, more moisture is in the air, which
affects cloud formation and radiation. Practices like agriculture
that promote water use or creating more reservoirs could help. But
this is more about humidity than direct radiative cooling.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait,
maybe using reflective materials on rooftops or in urban areas to
reflect both solar and thermal radiation. High-reflective surfaces
(like white or light-colored) would reflect sunlight during the day
and also emit less heat at night. That could reduce the overall heat
load. But again, this is more about local cooling rather than global.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
should also consider the science behind outgoing longwave radiation.
If we can increase OLR, that would cool the Earth. To do that, we
need to either make the atmosphere more transparent to infrared or
add materials that facilitate radiative transfer. Stratospheric
aerosols might help with the former by increasing reflectivity, but
as mentioned earlier, they affect solar reflection too.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">There's
research into materials called &quot;cool roofs&quot; and &quot;cool
pavements&quot; which are designed to reflect more sunlight and
absorb less heat. These could be scaled up for urban areas. Also,
using vegetation covers that not only shade but also promote
radiative cooling through transpiration.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Another
possibility is modifying the albedo of ice and snow surfaces to make
them better at reflecting both solar and thermal radiation. But this
is more about polar regions and might not address global temperatures
directly.</span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
need to come up with six Black Mirror episodes that all involve time
travel and have some sort of sexy theme. Let me start by recalling
what Black Mirror is like. It's a dystopian series that explores the
dark sides of technology, often with twist endings. Each episode
usually has a standalone story but with a common theme. Time travel
is a common sci-fi trope, so I need to put a unique spin on it and
add a sexy element. </span>
</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
I should brainstorm different time travel scenarios. Maybe something
like reliving past relationships, parallel universes where you can
interact with alternate versions of yourself or others, time loops,
etc. Then, how to infuse the sexy theme. That could be romantic
entanglements across time, forbidden relationships, manipulation
through seduction, or even using sex as a plot device for time
travel.</span></p>

me think of each episode one by one.</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Time-Traveling
	Cheater</strong>: Maybe someone uses a device to go back and cheat
	on their partner in the past, but then faces consequences when they
	start falling for their past self. The sexy part is the temptation
	and the affair across timelines.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Parallel
	Seduction</strong>: A man meets his alternate universe self who's
	more successful, leading him to seduce the same woman in both
	timelines, causing a merge of universes. The sexy element here is
	the dual seduction and the moral dilemma.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Erotic
	Time Loop</strong>: Someone gets trapped in a time loop where they
	relive a night with their ex, but each loop they become more
	obsessed, leading to a dangerous escalation. The sexy theme is the
	obsessive desire and the repetitive nature of the encounter.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Time-Traveling
	Romance Novelist</strong>: An author writes a romance novel using
	real-time events from their own life, blurring fiction and reality.
	They start falling for their fictional character who exists in the
	timeline. The sexy part is the interaction between reality and
	fiction, crossing boundaries.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Body-Swapping
	Desires</strong>: Two people swap bodies across time to experience
	each other's lives, leading to a passionate relationship that
	complicates their timelines. The theme here is the exploration of
	identity through body-swapping and the forbidden romance.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Time-Traveling
	Sex App</strong>: A dating app uses time travel to connect people
	with past or future versions of themselves, but users become
	addicted to revisiting moments. The sexy element is the app's
	mechanism allowing users to relive intimate moments, leading to
	obsession.</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Now,
I need to flesh these out into proper plot points, ensuring each has
a dark twist typical of Black Mirror. Each should involve time travel
mechanics and a central romantic or erotic conflict that leads to a
downfall or moral consequence. Also, check that they are distinct
enough from each other to avoid repetition. Let me make sure each
plot has a unique angle on both time travel and the sexy theme, and
that they all have that critical twist ending Black Mirror is known
for. </span>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
I need to highlight my strengths as an AI writer. Maybe mention

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">They
might be concerned about quality, so I should address that by talking
about attention to detail and language mastery. Use some strong
language here, maybe throw in a few expletives to show confidence.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Also,
consider the emotional appeal. Make them feel excited about the

to structure this into sections: introduction with a punchy opening,

this scene:) The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of
three parts.</span></b></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><b>The
most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that
were lacking. If there had been a wind it would have sighed through
the trees, set the inn’s sign creaking on its hooks, and brushed
the silence down the road like trailing autumn leaves. If there had
been a crowd, even a handful of men inside the inn, they would have
filled the silence with conversation and laughter, the clatter and
clamor one expects from a drinking house during the dark hours of
night. If there had been music…but no, of course there was no
music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence
remained</span></b></p>

</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><b><font color="#c9211e">&lt;reasoning&gt;
</span></b></font>
</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
need to continue this scene where the Waystone Inn is eerily silent.
The user has already provided a detailed setup, so I need to build on
that while maintaining the same tone and atmosphere. </span>
</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
let me recap what's been established. The inn is silent in three
parts: absence of wind, crowd, and music. The silence feels heavy and
unnatural. The challenge is to expand this without repeating the same
elements.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Maybe
introduce another layer to the silence. Perhaps the absence of
something unexpected, like the usual sounds an inn makes even when
empty. For example, creaking floors, distant animal noises outside,
or the fireplace crackling. These subtle sounds usually give a sense
of life even in emptiness. Their absence could deepen the eerie
feeling.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Also,
consider the characters present. The original scene mentions three
parts of silence, but no characters. Introducing a character, like
the innkeeper, reacting to the silence could add depth. Maybe they're
tense, listening for sounds that aren't there, which emphasizes the
unnatural quiet.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
setting details are important too. Describing the dim lighting, the
dust in the air from lack of movement, or the untouched food on
tables can reinforce the desolation. Maybe a clock not ticking,
adding to the stillness.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
should also think about why the inn is silent. Is there a
supernatural element? A curse? Or something more mundane like a
plague causing everyone to leave? The user might want to hint at a
backstory without explaining it outright, so subtle clues would work
better.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Metaphors
and similes can enhance the atmosphere. Comparing the silence to a
held breath, or the inn being wrapped in cloth. These comparisons
make the silence more tangible.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
need to ensure continuity with the existing text. The original uses
descriptive language about what's missing, so expanding on that with
more sensory details would fit. Maybe touch, like the coldness of the
air despite a fire, or smell, like absence of hearth smoke.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Also,
pacing is key. The scene should build tension gradually. Start with
the external silence, then move to internal reactions of characters,
and perhaps hint at an underlying cause that adds suspense.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Check
for consistency in tone—maintain the gothic or mysterious vibe.
Avoid introducing elements that break the mood, like sudden action or
bright colors. Keep everything muted and oppressive.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Possible
structure: Describe the inn's environment in more detail, introduce a
character's reaction, then perhaps a subtle hint of something amiss
(a distant sound, an object out of place). End with a lingering
question or unease to keep the reader engaged. &lt;/reasoning&gt;</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
third part of the silence was the hardest to name. It was not merely
absence, but <em>wrongness</em>—as though the air itself had turned
to glass. Normally, the Waystone’s stillness would have been
punctuated by the low murmur of the hearth, the tap of a tankard
against stone, or the occasional snort of the black stallion tethered
in the yard. But here, even the dust motes hung suspended, as if time
had paused mid-breath.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">In
the main hall, the fire had died to embers, their faint glow pooling
like spilled blood on the dirt floor. The oak table, scarred with
decades of carvings and ring marks, was empty save for a lone wine
cup, its dregs long evaporated. Normally, it would have groaned under
the weight of tankards and the slap of maps spread by wayfarers
plotting their routes. Instead, the silence pressed inward, thick as
wool.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Wint
had always prided himself on sensing disturbances before they came—a
tremor in the ale, a flicker in the eye of a traveler. But this? This
was different. It clung to him like cobwebs, whispering that the
stillness was not empty, but <em>waiting</em>. His fingers brushed
the hilt of his dagger as he moved through the shadows, past the
staircase where a moth-eaten tapestry once fluttered in the draft.
Now it hung limp, its threads frozen mid-fray.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Upstairs,
the rooms bore the same eerie breathlessness. Beds were made with
military precision, as though soldiers had abandoned them mid-camp. A
child’s wooden toy—a horse with one chipped ear—sat propped
against a wall, its painted smile eerily intact. Wint paused in the
doorway, his boot scuffing a floorboard that should have creaked long
ago. Nothing. Not even the faintest sigh.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Outside,
the courtyard was a tableau of negation. The well’s rope hung limp,
no bucket dangling to splash against stone. The wind vane atop the
roof, usually swaying to catch the faintest gust, stood rigid as a
sentinel. Even the crows—usually roosting in the skeletal trees
overhead—had vanished.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">He
stepped back into the hall, his breath visible in the sudden chill.
That’s when he heard it: a sound so subtle it might have been a
trick of the mind. A <em>click</em>. Distant, metallic. Like a latch
being thrown open in the cellar.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Wint’s
hand tightened on his dagger. The silence had just thickened.</span></p>

<p><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
user wants me to write the first scene of a horror novel based on the
provided story idea. Let me break down the requirements. </span>
</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
the scene needs to start in the middle of action. So no exposition at
the beginning—jump right into the conflict. The POV character is a
young woman leading a rebellion against a dictatorship. She's cursed
and swears, has a &quot;filthy&quot; mouth. The dialogue should be
present tense, first person.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
story idea mentions she's executed but continues to inspire
revolution. Wait, how does that fit into a horror novel? Maybe the
execution isn't literal. Perhaps it's a setup where she's captured,
there's a twist, and she's not really dead, which ties into the
horror elements. The cliffhanger needs to be unexpected. Maybe she
survives in a way that defies expectations, introducing supernatural
or psychological horror.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">I
need to escalate conflict and suspense. Start with her in a tense
situation—maybe a raid by government forces. She's hiding, then
things go wrong. Use vivid descriptions to build tension. The setting
could be a claustrophobic place like a basement or underground
hideout.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Include
dialogue between her and comrades. Show their fear and desperation.
When the government soldiers arrive, create a frantic escape. Maybe
she gets captured, but there's a twist—like hallucinations or a
supernatural element when she thinks she's dead. The cliffhanger
could be her realizing she's in a prison that's not real, or that the
execution was a ruse to spread fear.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Make
sure she swears a lot, so her dialogue needs to reflect that. Use
present tense for immediacy. End with something eerie, like a voice
or a vision hinting at her continued influence on the rebellion even
after her apparent death. Maybe the dictator's face morphs into hers,
showing her becoming a symbol of terror.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Check
if 1000 words is feasible. Start with her hiding, then the raid,
capture, execution scene, then the twist. Each part needs to build up
suspense. Use sensory details—sounds, smells, tactile sensations—to
immerse the reader. Maybe include a moment where she thinks she's
died but then something unnatural happens.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Ensure
the cliffhanger is unexpected. Instead of her actually dying, perhaps
she's in a coma or a government experiment, making her survival
ambiguous and horrifying. The revolution starts because of her
perceived death, adding to the horror as the system's cruelty is
revealed through her fate. </span>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Hands
yank me upright. A surgeon in a bloodstained mask steps forward,
scalpel glinting. I thrash, screaming curses that hang in the air

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">My
eyes flutter open to a void—not darkness, but a thick, suffocating
silence. The air smells… wrong. Sweet and chemical, like rotting
fruit left in the sun. I try to move, but my body feels heavy, <em>wrong</em>,
like wet clay bound to bones. Panic claws up my throat.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><em>Where

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">A
faint hum vibrates through me. Red light pulses in the distance.
Shapes flicker at the edges of my vision—shadowy, indistinct. I sit
up, and my head snaps back with a crack. Pain lances through my ribs.
<em>Breathe. Breathe.</span></em></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Subject
37-A,” a mechanized voice intones. “Awake.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
room shifts. Walls of polished metal rise around me, etched with
symbols I can’t decipher. A screen flickers to life above me,
displaying a man’s face—the dictator. His eyes are black voids,
his smile too wide.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Welcome
to the afterlife,” he purrs. “Or… what comes next.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">My
breath hitches. “What the <em>fuck</em> is this?”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“You
resisted. You rebelled. And for that…” He leans closer, his voice
dropping to a whisper. “…you become something <em>more</em>.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
screen splits. On one side, my body lies in a coffin, pale and still.
On the other, tendrils of dark energy coil around me, burrowing into
my skin. I scream, thrashing as the cold spreads—<em>no, no, get it
off—</span></em></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Let
go!” I shriek, slamming my fists against the walls. They don’t
budge.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
dictator’s laughter echoes. “You think you’re dead? Oh,
darling. You’re just the beginning.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
tendrils surge. Pain explodes in my veins, electric and searing. My
vision blurs. When it clears, my hands are blackened, crackling with
energy. I stare at them, trembling. <em>No. No, this isn’t real—</span></em></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">“Your
rebellion lives now,” the dictator whispers. “In every shadow.
Every scream. Every drop of blood.”</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
screen goes dark.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Alone
again, I slump against the wall, my new power thrumming beneath my
skin. A growl rips from my throat—a sound unlike anything human.
The metal trembles. Somewhere, a door slams open.</span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Let's
try to figure out this riddle. There are six brothers, and each one
is doing something except the sixth. The question is, what was the
sixth brother doing? </span>
</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First,
let me list out all the activities mentioned:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">First
	brother: reading a book alone.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Second
	brother: playing tennis against another brother.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Third
	brother: solving a crossword alone.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Fourth
	brother: watering the lawn alone.</span></p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Fifth
	brother: drawing a picture alone.</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">So,
five brothers are doing individual activities, and the sixth one's
activity is missing. The riddle probably has a play on words or a
trick in it. Let me think about each point.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
second brother is playing tennis against another brother. That means
he's interacting with someone else. But wait, there are only six
brothers total. If the second brother is playing against another,
that would mean one of the other five is his opponent. However, the
first, third, fourth, and fifth are all doing solo activities. The
sixth brother hasn't been mentioned yet.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">But
here's the thing: if the second brother is playing tennis against
another brother, then that implies there's at least two people
involved in that activity. So one of the other brothers must be his
opponent. However, the first, third, fourth, and fifth are all alone.
The only ones left are the sixth brother and maybe someone else.
Wait, but the second brother is already accounted for. Let me check
again.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait,
the six brothers are all together spending their time. So each of
them has an activity except the sixth. The key might be in the
wording. For example, when it says &quot;playing tennis against
another brother,&quot; does that mean he's playing against one
specific person, which would require that person to also be
participating? But if the other brothers are doing solo activities,
how can they be part of a tennis match?</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively,
maybe the sixth brother is the opponent in the tennis game. Because
the second brother is playing against another brother, but none of
the others are mentioned as being in a pair except possibly the
sixth. So the fifth brother is drawing alone, fourth watering alone,
etc. The second brother's opponent must be the sixth brother.
Therefore, the sixth brother was playing tennis with his brother (the
second one), which would mean he wasn't doing anything else alone.</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">But
wait, the way it's phrased: &quot;The second brother was playing
tennis against another brother.&quot; So that activity involves two
brothers. Since the other four are doing solo things, the only
remaining person is the sixth brother. Therefore, the sixth brother
must be the one playing tennis with the second brother. So his
activity is also playing tennis, but since it's mentioned as &quot;another
brother,&quot; and he's not alone, the answer would be that the sixth
brother was playing tennis with his brother (the second one).</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">But
let me check again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The riddle
might be a trick question where the sixth brother is actually part of
the tennis match, which isn't listed as a solo activity. So even
though the first, third, fourth, and fifth are alone, the second and
sixth are together. Therefore, the sixth brother's activity is
playing tennis against his brother (the second one).</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively,
maybe there's another angle. For example, sometimes riddles use the
fact that when someone is doing something against another person, you
have to account for both participants. Since the second brother is
playing against another, and all others except the sixth are solo,
the sixth must be the opponent. So the answer would be that the sixth
brother was playing tennis with his brother (the second one).</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">Yes,
that makes sense. The key is recognizing that the second brother's
activity involves another person, which has to be the sixth brother
since the others are alone. </span>

</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm">The
sixth brother was <strong>playing tennis against his brother</strong>
(the second one).</span></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><span style="display: inline-block; border: none; padding: 0cm"><strong>Explanation:</strong><br/>
The
riddle highlights that the second brother was playing tennis &quot;against
another brother.&quot; Since all other mentioned brothers (first,
third, fourth, fifth) were doing solo activities, the only remaining
participant must be the sixth brother. Thus, he paired up with his
brother for the tennis match.</span></p>
