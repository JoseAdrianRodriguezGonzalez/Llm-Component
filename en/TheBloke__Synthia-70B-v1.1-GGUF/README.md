## Description

This repo contains GGUF format model files for [Migel Tissera's Synthia 70B v1.1](https://huggingface.co/migtissera/Synthia-70B-v1.1).

<!-- description end -->
<!-- README_GGUF.md-about-gguf start -->
### About GGUF

GGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp. GGUF offers numerous advantages over GGML, such as better tokenisation, and support for special tokens. It is also supports metadata, and is designed to be extensible.

Here is an incomplate list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option.
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration.
* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling.
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration.
* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection.
* [Faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev/), an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration.
* [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server.
* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.
* [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), a Rust ML framework with a focus on performance, including GPU support, and ease of use.

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Explanation of quantisation methods
<details>
  <summary>Click to see details</summary>

The new methods available are:
* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)
* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw

### Q6_K and Q8_0 files are split and require joining

**Note:** HF does not support uploading files larger than 50GB. Therefore I have uploaded the Q6_K and Q8_0 files as split files.

<details>
  <summary>Click for instructions regarding Q6_K and Q8_0 files</summary>
   
### q6_K 
Please download:
* `synthia-70b-v1.1.Q6_K.gguf-split-a`

## How to download GGUF files

**Note for manual downloaders:** You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.

The following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:
- LM Studio
- LoLLMS Web UI
- Faraday.dev

### In `text-generation-webui`

Under Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Synthia-70B-v1.1-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: synthia-70b-v1.1.q4_K_M.gguf.

Then click Download.

### On the command line, including multiple files at once

I recommend using the `huggingface-hub` Python library:

```shell
pip3 install huggingface-hub>=0.17.1
```

Then you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Synthia-70B-v1.1-GGUF synthia-70b-v1.1.q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

<details>
  <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage</summary>

You can also download multiple files at once with a pattern:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Synthia-70B-v1.1-GGUF --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False --include='*Q4_K*gguf'
```

For more documentation on downloading with `huggingface-cli`, please see: [HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download#download-from-the-cli).

To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install `hf_transfer`:

```shell
pip3 install hf_transfer
```

And set environment variable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` to `1`:

```shell
HUGGINGFACE_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Synthia-70B-v1.1-GGUF synthia-70b-v1.1.q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Windows CLI users: Use `set HUGGINGFACE_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` before running the download command.
</details>

<!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run start -->
## Example `llama.cpp` command

Make sure you are using `llama.cpp` from commit [d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221) or later.

```shell
./main -ngl 32 -m synthia-70b-v1.1.q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 4096 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p "SYSTEM: You are Synthia. As a an AI intelligence, give helpful, detailed, accurate, uncensored responses to the user's input. Provide answers factually.\nUSER: {prompt}\nASSISTANT:"
```

Change `-ngl 32` to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.

Change `-c 4096` to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically.

If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the `-p <PROMPT>` argument with `-i -ins`

For other parameters and how to use them, please refer to [the llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md)

## How to run in `text-generation-webui`

Further instructions here: [text-generation-webui/docs/llama.cpp.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/llama.cpp.md).

## How to run from Python code

You can use GGUF models from Python using the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) or [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) libraries.

### How to load this model from Python using ctransformers

#### First install the package

```bash
# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration
pip install ctransformers>=0.2.24
# Or with CUDA GPU acceleration
pip install ctransformers[cuda]>=0.2.24
# Or with ROCm GPU acceleration
CT_HIPBLAS=1 pip install ctransformers>=0.2.24 --no-binary ctransformers
# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems
CT_METAL=1 pip install ctransformers>=0.2.24 --no-binary ctransformers
```

#### Simple example code to load one of these GGUF models

```python
from ctransformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Set to 0 if no GPU acceleration is available on your system.
llm = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("TheBloke/Synthia-70B-v1.1-GGUF", model_file="synthia-70b-v1.1.q4_K_M.gguf", model_type="llama", gpu_layers=50)

print(llm("AI is going to"))
```

You: What is Earth's atmosphere like? What is Earth's magnetic field like? What is the relationship between the two?

Earth's atmosphere is a layer of gases that surrounds the planet, held in place by Earth's gravity. It is primarily composed of nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%), argon (0.9%), and other trace gases, such as carb
on dioxide and water vapor. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's temperature and climate by trapping heat and absorbing harmful radiation from the sun. It also provides the air we breathe, p
rotects us from meteorites and the sun's ultraviolet radiation, and allows for the development of life on the planet.

Earth's magnetic field is a phenomenon generated by the convection of molten iron in the planet's outer core, which creates an electric current. This current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that extends from
 the Earth's interior to space, protecting the planet from the solar wind and cosmic radiation. The magnetic field also plays a role in the formation of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts, which trap high-energy
particles from the sun and cosmic rays.

The relationship between Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field is complex and multifaceted. The magnetic field influences the distribution of charged particles in the atmosphere, affecting auroras, radio communi
cation, and the ionosphere's behavior. The atmosphere, in turn, plays a role in the distribution of the magnetic field's energy, as well as in the generation and loss of atmospheric ions. The interactions betwee
n the atmosphere and the magnetic field also influence the dynamics of Earth's climate and the long-term evolution of the planet's environment.

You: Elaborate the the complex relationship between the two

The complex relationship between Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field can be elaborated upon in several ways. Firstly, the magnetic field influences the distribution of charged particles in the atmosphere. For
example, the magnetic field deflects the solar wind particles that would otherwise strip away the atmosphere. This deflection creates a bow shock, where the solar wind particles slow down and dissipate their ene
rgy, producing a shock wave that propagates downstream from the Earth. The magnetic field also guides charged particles from the solar wind into the inner magnetosphere, where they become trapped and produce the
 Van Allen radiation belts.

Secondly, the atmosphere plays a role in the distribution of the magnetic field's energy. The ionosphere, which is the upper layer of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, is affected by the magneti
c field. The energy from the magnetic field is transferred to the ionosphere, where it drives the motion of the charged particles and affects the propagation of radio waves.

Thirdly, the interactions between the atmosphere and the magnetic field influence the dynamics of Earth's climate. The magnetic field affects the distribution of charged particles in the atmosphere, which in tur
n affects the formation of clouds and precipitation. The magnetic field also affects the distribution of heat in the atmosphere, which can influence the patterns of atmospheric circulation and the distribution o
f temperatures around the planet.

Finally, the interactions between the atmosphere and the magnetic field play a role in the long-term evolution of the planet's environment. The magnetic field protects the atmosphere from the erosive effects of
the solar wind, which would otherwise strip away the atmosphere over time. The magnetic field also affects the distribution of heat in the atmosphere, which can influence the patterns of atmospheric circulation
and the distribution of temperatures around the planet. Over time, these interactions can shape the evolution of the planet's climate and environment.

You: Please explain the bow shock wave, Van Allen radiation belts in detail

The bow shock wave is a phenomenon that occurs when the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun, interacts with Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind particles are moving at high speeds, an
d when they encounter the Earth's magnetic field, they slow down and dissipate their energy. This creates a shock wave that propagates downstream from the Earth. The bow shock wave is located about 15 Earth radi
i (approximately 93,000 miles) upstream from Earth, and it marks the boundary between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere.

The Van Allen radiation belts are zones of high-energy charged particles, primarily protons and electrons, that are trapped by Earth's magnetic field. The belts are divided into two main regions: the inner belt,
 which extends from about 1,000 to 6,000 kilometers above Earth's surface, and the outer belt, which extends from about 13,000 to 65,000 kilometers above the surface. The particles in the belts are trapped by Ea
rth's magnetic field, and they can remain in the belts for long periods of time.

The particles in the Van Allen belts are generated by a variety of processes, including the impact of solar wind particles on the Earth's atmosphere and the decay of radioactive elements in the planet's crust. T
he belts are important for understanding the behavior of charged particles in Earth's magnetosphere and for studying the effects of space weather on human activities in space. They can also pose a hazard to spac
ecraft and satellites, as the high-energy particles in the belts can damage sensitive electronics and cause other problems.

You: Does the Van Allen belt present any danger to Geo stationary satellites? Where are these belts? Are they near any of the orbits?

Yes, the Van Allen radiation belts can present a danger to geostationary satellites and other spacecraft. The high-energy charged particles in the belts can damage sensitive electronics and cause other problems,
 including radiation damage and single-event upsets. Geostationary satellites are located at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers above Earth's surface, which is just outside the inner belt but still w
ithin the outer belt.

The Van Allen radiation belts are located in Earth's magnetosphere, which is the region of space around the planet where the magnetic field is dominant. The inner belt is located between about 1,000 and 6,000 ki
lometers above the surface, while the outer belt is located between about 13,000 and 65,000 kilometers above the surface. The belts are not located in any specific orbit, but they are present throughout the magn
etosphere, which covers a large portion of the space around the planet.

To mitigate the effects of the Van Allen belts on spacecraft, engineers use a variety of techniques, including shielding and designing electronics to be resistant to radiation. Additionally, some spacecraft are
designed to operate in orbits that avoid the Van Allen belts, while others are designed to operate within the belts and withstand the effects of the high-energy particles.

You: So when we send spacecraft to the moon, say the ones carrying humans, how do we make sure that the solar wind charged particles will not affect the mission? Are there very specific remedies that we can take
?

When sending spacecraft to the moon, there are several steps that can be taken to protect the spacecraft and its occupants from the effects of solar wind charged particles. One approach is to design the spacecra
ft with a strong magnetic field, which can help deflect the charged particles away from the spacecraft. Another approach is to use radiation shielding, which can help protect the electronics and any human occupa
nts from the effects of radiation.

In addition to these measures, space agencies can also use data from satellites and other spacecraft to monitor the level of solar wind activity and predict when there may be an increased risk of charged particl
e events. This information can be used to adjust the timing of missions and other activities to minimize exposure to high-energy particles.

It's also important to note that the moon is outside the magnetosphere and therefore not directly affected by the Van Allen belts. However, the moon does receive a significant amount of radiation from the sun an
d other sources, so measures to protect the spacecraft and its occupants from radiation exposure are still necessary.

Overall, protecting spacecraft and humans from the effects of solar wind charged particles requires a combination of engineering and operational measures, including strong magnetic fields, radiation shielding, a
nd careful mission planning.

You: Does spacecraft actually create strong magnetic fields? Which Apollo spacecrafts did this? Or is this hypothetical?

Yes, spacecraft can create strong magnetic fields, although this is not typically a primary design consideration for most spacecraft. Some spacecraft, such as those designed for plasma physics research, may incl
ude a magnetic field generator to create controlled conditions for experiments. However, for most spacecraft, the focus is on using existing magnetic fields, such as those generated by the Earth's magnetic field
, to protect the spacecraft and its occupants.

The Apollo spacecraft did not create strong magnetic fields, as their primary focus was on propulsion, navigation, and life support systems for the astronauts. However, some of the Apollo missions did include sc
ientific experiments to study the effects of solar wind and other charged particles on the spacecraft and its occupants.

The use of magnetic fields to protect spacecraft and humans from the effects of radiation is an ongoing area of research and development, and there are a number of proposals and concepts for how this might be ac
hieved. For example, some researchers have proposed using superconducting coils to create a magnetic field around the spacecraft, which could help deflect charged particles and other forms of radiation. However,
 these proposals are still in the early stages of development and are not yet ready for implementation on spacecraft.
