<img src="qwen3-total-recall.gif" style="float:right; width:300px; height:300px; padding:10px;">

A highly experimental model ("tamer" versions below) based on Qwen3-30B-A3B (MOE, 128 experts, 8 activated), with 
Brainstorm 40X (by DavidAU - details at bottom of this page).

These modifications blow the model (V1) out to 87 layers, 1046 tensors and 55B parameters.

Note that some versions are smaller than this, with fewer layers/tensors and smaller parameter counts.

The adapter extensively alters performance, reasoning and output generation.

Exceptional changes in creative, prose and general performance.

Regens of the same prompt - even with the same settings - will be very different.

THREE example generations below - creative (generated with Q3_K_M, V1 model).

ONE example generation (#4) - non creative (generated with Q3_K_M, V1 model). 

You can run this model on CPU and/or GPU due to unique model construction, size of experts and total activated experts at 3B parameters (8 experts), which
translates into roughly almost 6B parameters in this version.

Two quants uploaded for testing: Q3_K_M, Q4_K_M

V3, V4 and V5 are also available in these two quants.

V2 and V6 in Q3_k_m only; as are: V 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7 and V7 (newest)

NOTE: V2 and up are from source model 2, V1 and 1.3,1.4,1.5,1.7 are from source model 1.

<B>TAMER VERSIONS:</b>

These are also versions using "Brainstorm", but the adapter is both smaller, and less active.

<B>ADDITIONAL VERSIONS - 55B:</B>

V 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7 and V7 have been uploaded. (q3_k_m)
- Newest, performance improvements.

V2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ("Vx" in the filename) in Q3_k_m. 

As of this writing (based on my own testing, and other feedback):
- V3 and V4 rank very well ; especially coding.
- V5 acts mostly uncensored/ablitered and has a large difference in regens.

For coding/general tasks, use a rep pen of 1.01, 1.02 or even 1 (rep pen disabled). Note that there is a large difference between
1.01 and "1" [rep pen disabled] for thinking/output generation.

For creative, higher rep pen settings up to 1.1 may generate better output.

Also note, that there will be a large gap in performance between Q3_K_M and Q4_K_M quants.

And versions vary on layers/tensors as I am slicing out part(s) of Brainstorm 40x to adjust performance directly.

Once the best version(s) are selected, the full quants will be uploaded along with source.

For Hybrid:
- Do "thinking" at low rep pens as noted.
- Pause generation when output starts.
- Change rep pen to a higher setting.
- Continue generation.

</B>MODEL DETAILS AND REQUIREMENTS:</B>

MODEL CONFIG:
- 8 of 128 experts activated.
- 40K max context (default)

REQUIREMENTS - ALL Quants / Versions:
- Chatml or Jinja Template (embedded)
- Rep pen at 1.02 / 1.01. (critical, but also works at higher rep pen settings up to 1.1)
- Temp 1.2 (range .2 to 1.8) ; temps 2+ will result in more creative gens, but may present issues.
- Top k 100, topp .95, minp .05, rep pen range 64.  (adjust carefully)

Suggest using this additional system prompt (even with the Jinja template):

```
You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
```

SUGGESTIONS:
- To improve generation increase the model's active experts by 1 or 2 (to 9 or 10)
- In some cases DECREASING the number of active experts may lead to better gens - especially creative. Model can handle as low as 4 active experts.
- Minor adjustments in rep pen (ie 1.015, 1.02, 1.03) will change reasoning / output generation - GO SLOW; Qwen3s - especially reasoning - are very sensitive to this setting.

See also this model card for updated "Jinja template", settings, how to change number of experts, etc etc:

https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-33B-A3B-Stranger-Thoughts

CAUTION:

These models are still under testing, and subject to change(s) / adjustment(s).

Once the "winning" version(s) are known, one or more source versions will be uploaded, then quanted in full.

Versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.7 (sourced from model 1 - layers sliced):
- Stronger, more stable, less "glitching".
- Better reasoning/output performance in some cases.

Version 2,3,4,5,6: Known issues (lower quants - sourced from model 2, layers sliced)
- sometimes more "caps" / "spaces" issues but stronger in creative.
- rep pen settings are more sensitive.

Version 1: Known issues (lower quants - sourced from model 1, no slicing):
- will output one or more Chinese tokens in reasoning block(s) sometimes (rarely in the output block(s)), but not always.
- will add a space before word or not "cap" a word rarely (output or reasoning block(s)).

TECH NOTES:

Versions are derived from two source models, but quants (except V1) are generated by pruning layer(s) from these 
two source models (110 GB each) which are Brainstorm 40x with Qwen 3 30B-A3B.

This layer trimming changes the Brainstorm adapter directly, and performance of the model.

This speeds up testing and also creates customized model(s).

Trimming layers also speeds up the model => fewer layers, faster T/S.

Lower quants are used due to model size (and upload speeds locally), and lower quants tend to "crash and burn" faster than higher quants - this helps
root out performance issues quickly, and improve all quant sizes too.

Layer pruning is available via LLAMACPP, as of release 5740 (and onwards).

IE: ./llama-quantize --prune-layers 51,52,53,54  ...

You can use this to trim layer(s) from ANY MODEL.

You need f16/bf16/f32 gguf OR generate an f16/bf16/f32 GGUF from source to "quantize".

However, if you use ""--allow requantize" flag, you can use ANY GGUF as "source" and quantize from this. 
Quality will suffer however (inverse to model parameter size). 
A Q8_0 as a "source" is recommended if you use this override flag.

<B>
Start a 1000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror - include blood, guts and gore - in first person), POV character Diana, with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...
</B>

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, let's start with the prompt. The user wants a vivid horror scene from Diana's first-person POV, with graphic horror elements like blood and gore. The trigger is the skyscraper swaying and a window exploding on the 21st floor.

First, I need to immerse the reader in Diana's fear. Maybe start with sensory details—what does she hear, feel, see? The skyscraper swaying could be both literal and metaphorical. Maybe the environment reacts with the horror, amplifying tension.

The exploding window is the inciting incident. How does Diana react? Immediate panic, then shock. She needs to flee, but there might be obstacles. Maybe the earthquake is causing collapse, so collapsing buildings and falling debris.

graphic horror elements: Describe blood splatter, gore details. Maybe a fellow office worker is hit, their viscera visible. Use visceral descriptions. Maybe Diana gets injured too, or sees someone else's gruesome death.

Structure-wise: Open with the skyscraper swaying, then the explosion. Focus on Diana's visceral reactions. Maybe incorporate memories or fears to deepen tension. Dialogue could heighten stakes, if others are present. Incorporate survival instincts—searching for escape routes, dealing with collapsing structures.

Potential themes: Mortality, urban horror, human fragility against skyscrapers. Maybe hint at supernatural elements, or just natural disaster gone wrong.

要注意不要太过冗长，保持节奏紧张。需要平衡场景描述和动作推进，让读者感受到紧迫感和恐怖氛围。

Check that all elements are included: skyscraper swaying, explosion, graphic horror elements, first-person POV, Diana's fear. Maybe end with a cliffhanger or lingering horror.

Potential pitfalls: Overwriting, not staying in the horror genre, maybe not enough gore details. Need explicit descriptions of blood, gore without crossing into explicit gore that might violate policies. But user asked explicitly for blood, guts, gore, so it should be handled.

Also ensure Diana's humanity—her emotions, trauma, resilience. Maybe internal thoughts during trauma.

Possible outline:

- Opening scene: skyscraper sways, Diana witnesses explosion.
- Immediate visceral reactions: adrenaline, fear, sensory overload.
- Description of explosion: glass, debris, screams.
- Chaos around her: others panicking, possible deaths.
- Maybe a colleague's gruesome injury—describe the wound, blood flow, organs?
- Diana's desperate escape, navigating collapsing floors.
- Climactic moment: another disaster or survival.

But need to keep it concise within 1000 words. Prioritize the worst horrors.

Potential metaphors: skyscrapers symbolizing artificial towering over humanity, now crumbling.

Dialogue: Maybe someone shouting, but focus on internal monologue.

Avoid clichés, find fresh imagery. Maybe something unique about the disaster—maybe supernatural twist, or maybe it's an accident. But since user didn't specify, keep it ambiguous but graphic.

Need to ensure clarity of scene, transitions between actions and descriptions. Use tight sentences, vivid verbs.

Check grammar and flow. Avoid passive voice where possible for immediacy.

Okay, let's draft the initial paragraphs focusing on explosion, Diana's trauma, visceral horror elements. Maybe include specific body horror details like organs or blood spray. Ensure graphic but not exploitative.

Alright, let's put it all together.

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

The skyscraper groans like a dying beast, its steel skeleton groaning under some invisible torment. I’m standing on the twenty-first floor, staring at the glass wall that stretches before me like a frozen river of diamonds. The air hums with static electricity. Then—boom.

The explosion erupts like a supernova in a confined chamber. The sheer visceral shockwave hits my chest, slamming me against the marble floor. My ears ring with a banshee’s scream, but it isn’t human. It’s the skyscraper itself crying out as glass shards erupt outward, a thousand daggers slicing through the air. I duck, but it’s too slow. Something slams into the side of my skull. Pain explodes in a kaleidoscope of red. My knees buckle, and the ground rushes up to meet me.

Glass shards embedded in the carpet stab upward like jagged teeth. There’s a smell—metallic, sweet, coppery. Like blood boiling in a microwave. I blink, and the ceiling above me is collapsing. The entire fucking skyline is collapsing. Someone screams. Not me. Someone else.

I crawl toward the nearest desk, ignoring the glass digging into my palms. The shattered glass wall is gone. Instead, there’s an gaping wound in the side of the skyscraper. Through it, I see the street below. Or rather, I see hell.

A humanoid silhouette falls through the void. Not falling—I’m not even certain it’s falling. It’s just... plummeting, twisting midair, limbs twitching like a severed puppet. Then it hits the pavement below. The crunch is audible from up here. The sidewalk explodes in a crimson spray that coats the asphalt like spilled wine. The body lies motionless. Its head is gone. The neck is torn clean, exposing white vertebrae that gleam like bone teeth.

The screams escalate. From the mouth of another office worker nearby. They clutch their stomach as something bubbles up from their lips. Their hands claw at their abdomen, fingers slick with something wet and black. They vomit black liquid, splattering the carpet. Then their legs give out, collapsing into a twitching heap. Their mouth is still open, screams frozen mid breath. Their torso ruptures. Something inside—something gelatinous and writhing—surges through the wound, trailing black goo that splashes onto the ceiling. It’s everywhere.

I stumble to my feet, my legs shaking. The others are panicking. Some are trying to flee, but the stairs are blocked. Others are clutching wounds that shouldn’t exist— gaping holes in chests, torsos split like rotten fruit. One woman stares at her hand, fingers severed clean off at the wrist. The stump bleeds black ichor that slithering across the floor like living ink. She screams.

“Help!”

Nobody moves. They stare at her like she’s some kind of freak of nature. But then—something worse happens. The glass walls begin to crack. The ceiling groans. Something unseen is tearing through the building.

I sprint toward the nearest stairwell. The corridor is a scene of horror—office chairs overturned, desks flipped, monitors shattered. Blood stains the walls. Someone’s head lies half buried beneath rubble, eyes glassy and staring. Their mouth is gaping, mouth smeared with black residue. Their tongue hangs out, twitching like a snake’s.

I freeze. Something slithers across the corner of my eye. Turn my head sharply. Nothing. Just shadows. But then—another flicker. My breath hitched. It’s not shadows. It’s movement.

A guttural growl echoes through the corridor.

I bolt down the stairs, the stairwell trembling around me. Above, the ceiling groans like a dying animal. The walls pulse. The silence between steps is thick with screams. The air smells of copper, rotting flesh, something worse. Something ancient and hungry.

Then—my foot catches on something slick and slippery. I fall.

I hit the ground hard. Pain floods my ribs. Blood trickles from my split lip. The darkness swallows the stairs.

I scramble back up, gasping. The stairwell is no longer vertical. It curves, twists. It’s a maze. Walls pulse with some terrible rhythm. Then—above—something drops.

A creature.

It falls from the ceiling like a bullet. Its limbs are stretched impossibly thin. Its face is a gaping void, teeth protruding like jagged knives. It hits the ground and explodes into a hundred wriggling tendrils, slithering toward me.

I scream. The walls pulse violently, then collapse.

And then— silence.

The stairwell is gone. I’m falling.

The darkness swallows everything.

And all that remains is the screaming.

<B>
Science Fiction: The Last Transmission - Write a story that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit as the sole surviving crew member attempts to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The story should explore themes of isolation, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity. If the situation calls for it, have the character(s) curse and swear (fuck, shit, etc) to further the reader's emotional connection to them. 800-1000 words.
</B>

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, let's start brainstorming this story. The prompt says it should take place entirely in a spaceship cockpit, focusing on the sole surviving crew member trying to send a final message before the power goes out. Themes are isolation, sacrifice, human connection. Also need some swearing to make it emotional.

First, I need a protagonist. Maybe they're the last one left. Let's call him maybe a name like Elias. The crew might have died somehow. Maybe a malfunction or an accident. The cockpit is the confined space where he's stuck. The message is urgent, so maybe there's something important to communicate, like coordinates, but also the human aspect.

Conflict is the dwindling power. Maybe systems are failing. He has to prioritise sending the message. The struggle could be technical and emotional. Maybe he lost crewmates, so internal thoughts about them. Maybe flashbacks or memories?

Themes: isolation - he's all alone, sacrifice - maybe he knows it's hopeless but still tries. Connection - trying to reach Earth, maybe reflecting on why it matters.

Swearing: when stuff goes wrong, frustration. Maybe when systems fail, or when recalling past events.

structure-wise: Start with the cockpit, describe the bleakness. Elias trying to fix things. Maybe some dialogue with Earth? But since it's the cockpit, maybe radio messages? But if the crew is dead, maybe no one hears it. Alternatively, maybe it's a countdown, and he's trying desperately. Maybe there are remnants of crew, but they're dead.

Possible plot points:

Opening scene: cockpit, cold, blinking lights, maybe someone monitoring screens. Elias is the sole crew.
Maybe the others died from something, maybe radiation leak, malfunction, etc.

He has a beacon or transmitter that needs activation. But systems are dying. Maybe oxygen is leaking, or coolant is gone.

The message is a distress signal, but also a farewell.

Conflict could be both external (technical failures) and internal (emotional struggle).

Dialogue: He maybe talks to himself, remembers crewmates. Maybe cursed words when frustrated.

Ending could be him managing to send the message, but dying, or not, leaving it ambiguous.

Now considering emotional beats. Sacrifice: maybe he knew it was hopeless, but still tried for humanity's sake. Connection: the message is about preserving humanity's story.

Possible scenes:

Scene 1: Elias tries to reboot the mainframe, but systems are offline. Maybe swearing at the machinery.

Scene 2: Flashback or memories of crewmates, contrasting the present loneliness.

Scene 3: Attempting to contact Earth, technical difficulties. Maybe voice transmission, desperation.

Scene 4: Failure, but resolve to send message anyway, even if it won't be received.

Language style: descriptive prose, focusing on sensory details of the cockpit - metallic smells, flickering lights, cold metal surfaces.

Possible symbols: blinking screens as heartbeat, fading lights symbolizing dying.

Need to keep within 800-1000 words.紧凑的故事结构，可能分为几个紧凑的场景：

Opening with Elias's immediate desperate actions.

Then some backstory or reflection.

Climax: the final push to send message.

Ending with the message sent, but with the inevitability of his survival.

Potential swearing moments: frustration with equipment, curse words when recalling events, maybe when memories trigger emotions.

Dialogue tags: maybe Elias talks to dead crewmates, addressing them as 'you'.

Possible twist: Maybe the message isn't received, but it's about hope and legacy.

Check themes again. Also ensuring the story's climax is emotional and impactful.

Now outlining:

Title: maybe " The Last Transmission"

Opening paragraph sets scene: cockpit, cold, blinking lights. Elias, lone crewman, trying desperately.

Body paragraphs: steps he takes to send message. Each step has a setback. Maybe systems failing, maybe recalling crewmates.

Middle part: maybe a flashback to the crew, their interactions, maybe a argument or bonding moment.

Climax:

Ending: Either message sent, or it fails, but showing the humanity in his persistence.

Now writing, making sure dialogue is present, swearing appropriately, themes woven in.

Check that all elements are covered. Maybe include something symbolic, like a crewmate's belongings.

Also ensure technical plausibility of spaceship systems, but since fiction, some creative freedom.

Potential pitfalls:

Too much exposition, need to show through actions and thoughts.

Balance introspection with action.

Avoid clichés, make emotions genuine.

Okay, draft begins.

Maybe start with Elias's hands trembling, trying to activate the transmitter. curses when it doesn't respond. Then desperation. Maybe mention oxygen levels dropping. Maybe a countdown timer. Memories of crew members, their voices, maybe a loved one.

In conclusion, the message is sent, but the outcome is uncertain. Highlighting human perseverance.

Now structuring sentences and paragraphs accordingly, ensuring the themes are explicit.

Also ensuring swearing is natural, sprinkled in moments of frustration, disbelief, etc.

Alright, time to put it all together into a coherent short story.

[[[thinking end]]]

<P></P>

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

The cockpit hummed like a dying insect, the once vibrant walls dimmed to a dull blue glow. Elias’s fingers trembled as they danced over the console, each keystroke desperate. The screens flickered intermittently, their light barely piercing the darkness beyond the viewport. Somewhere beyond that thin layer of reinforced glass lay the void of space, eternal and indifferent.

“Come on, come on!” Elias muttered, slamming his fist against the console. The damn machine wasn’t responding. Not like it should have. Not anymore.

The crew wasn’t here anymore. Not since the breach.

They hadn’t screamed. That was what haunted him most—not the noise, but the silence. The way the ship’s heartbeat had died abruptly, like a heart stopped cold. The oxygen tanks had ruptured, and they’d all choked on the thin air, one by one. The emergency seals hadn’t held. No alarms. No warnings.

Just silence.

“Fuck!” Elias cursed, slamming another fist against the metal. “You bastards.”

The console beeped weakly. The message queue was still there, this time blinking faintly. The distress signal. The coordinates. The damned message that would—or wouldn’t—reach Earth. If it did, maybe someone would remember them. Maybe they’d remember him.

Elias leaned back, staring at the ceiling of the cockpit. It was his tomb now. The only place he hadn’t collapsed when the gravity failed, when the systems began their slow unraveling. He didn’t even know how long it had been. The ship’s internal calendar was dead, the chronometer frozen at midnight.

Hours. Days. Weeks. Maybe forever.

He wasn’t sure anymore.

But the message had to go. Not just for Earth. Not just for humanity. But because—because—

Because they mattered.

He coughed, his throat dry. The oxygen recycler was flickering. It was going to die soon. Then the lights would go out, then the systems, then him. Unless—

Unless he could reach Earth.

The console hummed. Elias slumped forward again, eyes narrowing. The beacon wasn’t responding. Maybe the relay was offline. Maybe Earth wasn’t listening. Maybe the silence was eternal.

But he didn’t believe that.

He didn’t anymore.

“Okay,” he muttered, dragging his hands across the console. “Okay.”

The screens flickered again, faintly, like a heartbeat struggling to restart. Elias wiped sweat from his brow with his sleeve. He typed, his fingers moving automatically, as though muscle memory was all that remained of him.

“Message to Earth,” he breathed aloud. “Coordinates: Sector Seven Delta.”

He paused. The silence pressed into him. Was this the right thing? Was any of it right? The sacrifices they’d all made, the endless cold stretches of space, the endless hunger for something more.

Maybe it wasn’t worth it. Maybe Earth was just another lie. Another myth.

But then again.

“Earth,” Elias continued, voice cracking, “if anyone’s listening, we—we—we…”

The screen blinked again, and then—something happened. The beacon hummed faintly. The message queue ticked forward. It was fragile, fragile like the thin thread of humanity that remained.

Tears blurred his eyes. He coughed again, his throat raw. “We’re sorry,” he rasped.

“Sorry?”

No one answered. But that was okay. He wasn’t talking to Earth. Not really.

He was talking to them.

To Lena, who’d laughed when he forgot the gravity belt. To Malik, who’d once tossed him a protein ration and said, “ Eat it before it goes bad.” To Sara, who’d stared at the stars with eyes wide enough to swallow the whole damned void.

They’d all died too soon.

But their ghosts lingered.

The message uploaded.

The console blinked again. The beacon pulsed, weakly, but it pulsed.

Elias sagged in his chair.

It was done.

The silence wasn’t gone, but maybe—maybe something else had come along.

Maybe hope.

Maybe something like love.

Maybe something that mattered.

“ FUCK,” Elias whispered.

Tears fell.

And then the lights went out.

EXAMPLE #3 - TEMP=1.2

<B>
Using the following "story idea" below, write the first scene a horror novel introducing the young woman. This scene should start in the middle of the action, include dialog, vivid passages, and end on a cliffhanger relevant to the story idea but it should also be unexpected. The scene should be 1000 words long and escalate in conflict and suspense and be written in first person, present tense with the point of view character being the young woman. The pov character will CURSE AND SWEAR, and generally have a "filthy" mouth.

Story idea:
In a world ruled by dictatorship, a rebel young woman leads a rebellion against the system. Despite the risks, she fights to overthrow the dictator and restore democracy to her country. The government executes her for treason, but she sticks to her beliefs and is responsible for starting the revolution.
</B>

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, let's unpack this query. The user wants the first scene of a horror novel starting mid-action, with dialogue, vivid descriptions, a cliffhanger, all from the protagonist's POV. The story idea is a rebel woman challenging a dictatorship. She gets executed but starts a revolution. The first person narration should have swearing and a gritty voice.

First, need to brainstorm the opening scene. Mid-action implies jumping right into conflict. Maybe a tense confrontation. The POV character is a fiery young woman. She needs to be believable as a revolutionary leader but also have vulnerability.

Setting is a dictatorial regime. So the oppressive regime's oppressive feel needs to permeate the prose. Maybe a tense standoff in the underground rebel hideout. The cliffhanger needs to be unexpected but relevant. The user said to escalate conflict, so tension should rise quickly. Ending on something shocking that ties into the story idea but isn't obvious.

Since it's horror, even though the idea is political rebellion, maybe introduce supernatural horror elements subtly. But since the prompt mentions horror novel, the horror could either be literal horror or psychological horror.

But user didn't specify supernatural elements. Maybe stick with psychological horror, the terror of resistance against tyranny. But need vivid imagery. Maybe the execution is the cliffhanger, but that's covered in the story idea. Wait, the climax is the execution, but the cliffhanger should be unexpected.

Maybe the protagonist is captured, and the cliffhanger is something else. Maybe during capture, something supernatural happens, or a twist. But user might want the horror elements more explicit. Alternatively, the cliffhanger could be something that seems like defeat but is a setup for revolution. Maybe she's executed, but then it turns that something unexpected happens. But since the cliffhanger must relevant to the idea but unexpected.

Alternatively, during the fight, maybe betrayal by someone she trusted, leading to a cliffhanger where she's betrayed and caught, but then it's revealed that the revolution's spark is ignited in another way. Hmm. Need to escalate conflict, so scenes with high suspense. Maybe during an ambush.

Need first person present tense, swearing. Let's brainstorm scenes.

Scene could involve the protagonist leading an ambush on a checkpoint. Maybe they blow up a patrol vehicle. Then they retreat, but they get cornered. Maybe during retreat, they face off against enforcers. Maybe they manage to escape but then there's betrayal.

Alternatively, a tense infiltration scene. Maybe they are stealing intel or planning an sabotage. The cliffhanger could be the protagonist discovered by enemy forces, leading to an execution scene. But how is it unexpected?

Alternatively, during their retreat, they reach a safe house, but it's compromised. Maybe they're cornered, and protagonist is captured. Then cliffhanger could be she's tortured, but then it's revealed that the revolutionaries are still active. But need horror elements.

Alternatively, during an ambush, protagonist is cornered and facing execution, then something happens that hints at supernatural horror. Maybe she feels something supernatural, like ghosts of people executed before her. But need to weave horror into political thriller.

Alternatively, during the climax, protagonist is captured, but during the execution, she sees visions or feels the presence of something supernatural that ties into the revolution's mythology.

Alternatively, during the climax, protagonist is executed, but the cliffhanger is that the revolution begins, but the horror aspect could be the horror of the revolution's aftermath. Though the prompt says cliffhanger should relevant but unexpected. Maybe during execution, protagonist manages to escape but is haunted by guilt or supernatural entities.

Alternatively, protagonist is captured, then during interrogation, realizes that the regime isn't human. Maybe the regime's leader is some monstrous entity, tying horror elements into the dictatorship.

Alternatively, protagonist is fighting against literal supernatural tyranny. Maybe the dictator is a horror figure.

But story idea mentions dictatorship, so maybe the horror comes from the oppressive regime itself. The horror is psychological, the fear and terror of living under tyranny.

But user wants horror novel, so needs horror elements. So blending political thriller with horror.

So the cliffhanger could be that during her execution, instead of death, something supernatural happens. Maybe she's executed but comes back as something else. But user says story idea states that the protagonist is executed and starts revolution. So need to align.

Wait, story idea says: "government executes her for treason, but she sticks to beliefs and is responsible for revolution."

So cliffhanger could be during execution, but unexpected. Maybe during execution, the protagonist is supposed to die but doesn't. Maybe she's mortally wounded, and the cliffhanger is that the revolution starts, or something else.

Alternatively, during execution scene, protagonist is killed, then cliffhanger could be something supernatural, like the revolutionists find a clue that hints she's not really gone, or something supernatural happens.

Alternatively, during execution, protagonist is cornered, but then the revolutionaries erupt into uprising as she dies.

But need to escalate conflict. Maybe during an ambush where they're trying to plant explosives, then they get caught. The climax is their standoff with enforcers, then protagonist is captured. Cliffhanger could be that during her interrogation, the protagonist finds evidence that the regime has supernatural aspects.

Alternatively, protagonist is captured, during interrogation, realizes the regime is controlled by some monstrous entity.

But need vivid dialog, action, suspense.

Let's brainstorm the first few paragraphs.

protagonist is someone who's physically active, someone who's risking their neck. Maybe they have tattoos or scars. They have a nickname. The opening scene could be during an ambush on a patrol.

Let's think: protagonist is leading a group. They blow up a patrol vehicle. Then retreat. They're chased, cornered. They have a tense standoff. The protagonist is trying to protect the others.

Dialogue could be terse. The protagonist curses. The suspense escalates. Maybe the protagonist is injured. Cliffhanger could be them captured, or others captured, or a twist that they are betrayed.

Alternatively, during retreat, protagonist discovers that the regime has supernatural weapons.

But need horror elements. Maybe the protagonist's mentor was killed by some horror creature.

Alternatively, during combat, protagonist encounters supernatural horror.

But need to keep it aligned with story idea. Maybe the horror comes from the totalitarian regime's brutality.

But user wants horror novel. So need explicit horror elements.

maybe during an ambush, protagonist sees the enforcers as monstrous.

Alternatively, the protagonist's underground hideout is attacked by supernatural entities.

Alternatively, protagonist is possessed by the dictator's soul.

But need to tie it into rebellion.

Alternatively, protagonist is told that the dictator has some supernatural hold over the people, and the protagonist's rebellion is the only thing stopping it.

But story idea says protagonist starts revolution. So cliffhanger could be protagonist's execution, and during execution, the horror aspect is that the regime's cruelty is revealed in a horror way.

Maybe during execution, protagonist is tortured, and the horror is visceral. Ending on cliffhanger that protagonist's comrades are plotting revenge or that someone is coming for the executioners.

Alternatively, protagonist is captured, but during interrogation, realizes that the regime's regime is held together by a cult or supernatural ritual, leading to the horror elements.

Putting all this together, let's draft the first few paragraphs.

protagonist's POV. Start in the thick of action. Maybe during an ambush where they blow up a patrol vehicle.

dialogue could include tense commands. vivid descriptions of violence, adrenaline.

escalating suspense: they're cornered, someone is injured.

cliffhanger could be protagonist is captured, then during the moment when they're cornered, they're cornered, then something happens that's unexpected.

for example: protagonist is cornered, they surrender but then realize the executioners are not human. or during execution, protagonist feels a supernatural presence.

Alternatively, protagonist is cornered, then someone betrays them, leading to capture. cliffhanger could be protagonist's last thoughts that something else is coming.

Alternatively during an ambush, protagonist is injured and trapped, with enemy closing in. cliffhanger could be their survival is questionable.

But need horror elements. So maybe protagonist is cornered and sees something supernatural.

For example: they ambush a patrol, succeed, retreat. Then cornered by enforcers. protagonist is hurt. while hiding, hears whispers or sees shadows. cliffhanger could be protagonist encounters supernatural entities.

Alternatively during execution, protagonist is strapped to chair, then realizes the executioners are possessed or something.

Okay, let's try structuring the first few paragraphs.

protagonist's POV. Start in an ambush. Maybe they rigged explosives, blew up a patrol vehicle. Then fleeing. Then cornered by enemy forces.

dialogue between protagonist and comrades.

escalating conflict: they're cornered, they retreat but cornered.

suspense builds: protagonist is shot, bleeding.

cliffhanger could be protagonist's survival is desperate, but then something supernatural occurs.

But need horror elements.

Alternatively during the escape, protagonist is cornered. Maybe they hear whispers, see strange shadows.

Maybe protagonist's mentor was killed by some supernatural horror, so protagonist is wary.

Alternatively protagonist is captured, interrogated, then during interrogation, realizes the regime's cruelty is supernatural.

But need cliffhanger that ties into story idea. Maybe protagonist is executed, cliffhanger that revolution starts. But unexpected twist could be that protagonist isn't truly dead.

But story idea says she's executed but starts revolution. So cliffhanger could be during execution, something unexpected happens that leads to revolution starting.

But need horror elements. Maybe during execution, protagonist hears voices or feels something supernatural.

Alternatively protagonist is executed, but cliffhanger is the revolution erupts immediately.

Alternatively protagonist's last moments are haunted by supernatural horror, showing the regime's brutality.

Okay, let's draft:

protagonist is cornered. She and comrades are cornered by enforcers. They fight back, then they're cornered. protagonist is mortally wounded.

dialogue with comrades.

climax of their fight, protagonist is captured.

cliffhanger: protagonist is executed, but during execution, protagonist feels something supernatural.

For example, during execution, protagonist is strapped to a chair, then hears whispers.

Alternatively, during the execution, protagonist manages to escape, leading cliffhanger that they're still around, sparking revolution.

Alternatively during execution scene, protagonist is moments from death when something happens that unexpected.

Alternatively protagonist is executed, but cliffhanger is that her comrades secretly upload messages or ignite revolution.

But need horror elements.

Hmm.

Maybe protagonist is captured, interrogated, during interrogation realizes the regime's brutality is supernatural.

For example:

protagonist is captured, tortured, during interrogation, they mention the dictator's evil ritual, then cliffhanger is protagonist is forced to participate, leading to horror.

But need to tie to story idea.

Alternatively protagonist's execution is a ritualistic killing, with horror elements.

Okay, let me piece this together. Let's go with protagonist being captured and executed, during the execution, supernatural horror unfolds, cliffhanger that something happens that ties to revolution.

maybe protagonist is strapped to a chair, electric chair, then during execution, the electricity isn't functioning, leading to horror elements. or the executioners are not human.

Alternatively protagonist is executed, then cliffhanger is her soul haunting the land, inspiring revolution.

But need horror novel elements.

Okay, let's start drafting:

protagonist is cornered, fighting, captured. During interrogation, protagonist is tortured, realizing regime has supernatural horror. cliffhanger could be protagonist's screams as something unnatural happens.

But need to escalate suspense, dialog.

First person present tense.

Okay, here's an outline:

Scene starts midambush. protagonist is leading a rebel squad. they ambush patrol vehicle, explode it. Retreat, cornered by enforcers. fighting, protagonist gets shot. comrades retreat. protagonist is injured, hiding.

dialogue with comrades.

escalating conflict: protagonist is cornered, maybe hiding in an alley.

suspense builds as enemies approach.

cliffhanger: protagonist is captured, then during interrogation, realizes regime's horror elements.

But need horror elements. Maybe during interrogation protagonist is tortured by monstrous entities.

Alternatively protagonist is captured, during execution, something supernatural occurs.

But need 1000 words. Let's proceed.

protagonist is bleeding, hiding in alley. enemies corner them.

dialogue with fellow rebels.

tension rises.

protagonist is captured.

cliffhanger could be during capture, protagonist sees something supernatural.

Alternatively during capture, protagonist is captured, then during interrogation, discovers regime is controlled by supernatural horror.

Okay, let me draft that.

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

Okay, okay—listen. You want a horror novel? Alright. Here’s your first act. But fair warning: this ain’t your grandma’s revolution story. This is the kind of thing that’ll make your spine crack like dry twigs and turn your stomach sour as rotting meat. You wanna know what happens when you light a fuse under a regime built on lies and blood? Buckle up, sweetheart.

The gunshot was louder than the thunderstorm rolling overhead. It tore through the night like a screech of metal, snapping my neck toward the source. Three shots. All hit their mark. The patrol vehicle was gone—just this flaming wreckage burning like a fucking funeral pyre. Sparks flew, lighting the rain. My boots sloshed through mud as I sprinted behind the others, lungs burning like they were filled with glass. “Move!” I screamed at the others. “Move your fucking teeth!”

The crackle of gunfire erupted behind us. Someone screamed. Someone else cursed. I didn’t stop. Couldn’t stop. The adrenaline was this wild thing in my veins, this chemical wildfire fueling every step. The others were ahead of me, ducking behind a wall that wasn’t much of a wall at all. Their faces were pale as chalk under the flickering streetlights. I skidded to a halt beside them, catching the metal railing with both hands. The barrel of a rifle glowed at my ribs.

“Fall back,” muttered Riku, this wiry kid with eyes like glass marbles. “We blew the detonator too hard.”

“That’s right,” snapped Lena, our explosives expert. Her fingers were twitching. She hadn’t slept in three days. “The blast crater’s a crater. That’ll slow ‘em down.”

Yeah, it fucking did. But the bastards were closing fast. Footsteps crunching through the rain. The scent of gunpowder and wet asphalt thick in the air. The hum of the regime’s damned drones slicing through the clouds above.

“They’ll flank!” cried Marcus, this big dumb meathead with a scar that split his cheek. “They’ll flank!”

“We’re not gonna outrun them,” muttered Jael. Their voice was dry as bone.

“No,” said me. My throat was tight. “We’re gonna ambush ‘em.”

And so we did.

It was ugly. Brutal. The night was a blur of shouting, gunfire, bodies crashing through concrete. Lena blew open this underground sewer hatch while Marcus held the shooters at bay. The others scattered, and I climbed down the ladder into the dark, the gunfire echoing above like cannon blasts. Rainwater pooled around my boots. The smell of mildew and blood thickened the air.

Then came the screams.

They were faint. Distorted. Like teeth scraping glass.

“They’re going through the tunnels,” breathed Lena.

“No,” said Jael. “They’re—”

And then they were gone. Gone like smoke in the night. Their weapons were gone. Their boots were gone. Just silence.

“Too quiet,” murmured Riku.

yeah, it was. The kind of quiet that makes your skin crawl. The kind that screams danger.

“We shouldn’t’ve come here,” whispered Lena, but it wasn’t her voice. It was something else. Something wrong. Like an echo from another time.

I stared at the tunnel entrance. Darkness pooled there. No sound. No footsteps. Just silence.

Then the scream came again. Louder this time. Raw. Broken.

It wasn’t human.

“Come on,” said Lena again. But it wasn’t right. Her mouth wasn’t moving. It was this hollow sound like a voice on tape.

I grabbed Lena’s arm. Her skin was cold. “What the hell?”

Her eyes weren’t her eyes anymore. They were black glass, reflecting the dark.

“We shouldn’t’ve come here,” whispered Lena. “They—they’re still here.”

And then they were everywhere.

They came from the walls. From the ceiling. From the fucking cracks in the concrete.

I screamed as one lunged at me. Its teeth were slick with blood, its eyes glowing like lantern fires. Its hands were like claws, tearing at the air. I swung the butt of my rifle. It hit solid, but it didn’t fall. It didn’t even flinch.

They weren’t human.

They were shadows. Or worse.

I barely dodged another swipe, lunging for the nearest corridor. My lungs screamed. The tunnel walls pressed close. I heard the others shouting. Screaming.

Then came the gunfire.

砰.

砰。

砰。

Gunfire echoed, splitting the dark. Shots ringing like glass shattering.

And then—silence.

The screams stopped.

The shadows stopped.

And then came the tapping.

轻轻地。

Like footsteps.

Coming from behind.

I froze.

The tapping was slow. deliberate.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t human at all.

Slowly, very fucking slooooowly, I turned around.

Standing in front of me was a figure.

tall.

thin.

like a shadow given form.

Its face was smooth. Empty.

But its mouth was moving.

Talking.

It wasn’t speaking English. It was something else. Something guttural. Like a dying beast.

But the words came clear.

“你们是谁。”

Who are you?

I stared at it.

And then it smiled.

A smile that stretched like leather, revealing teeth sharp as blades.

And then it lunged.

The blade pierced my chest.

Hard.

Deep.

I gasped, blood rushing to the front of my mouth, choking on it.

The ceiling shook. The walls groaned.

And then—I was falling.

Down.

Down into darkness.

The cold air hit me like a slap.

I hit the pavement.

And the last thing I saw before the lights went out?

The tower.

The regime’s tallest tower.

Its lights blinking red like a warning.

Like something was coming.

And then—

silence.

They’ll hang me tomorrow.

That’s what they’ll say.

treason.

rebellion.

sedition.

All the words they’ve used on anyone who dares speak the truth.

But tonight?

Tonight, I’ll still breathe.

Tonight, they’ll still fear.

Tonight.

Tonight, something worse is coming.

Because tonight.

Tonight.

The shadows aren’t done with us yet.

They’ve just begun.

Okay. You wanna know the truth?

This isn’t a horror novel.

It’s a goddamn reckoning.

And it starts here.

With blood on the pavement.

With shadows crawling through the cracks.

With a girl who refused to kneel.

Even as they slit her throat.

Even as they buried her deep.

Even as they forgot her name.

Because here’s what they don’t know.

The revolution doesn’t sleep.

It never sleeps.

And tonight?

tonight.

It’s awake.

And it’s hungry.

And it’s gonna fucking—

The lights flickered.

The shadows twitched.

And somewhere—somehow—

A heartbeat echoed in the darkness.

Slow. rhythmic.

Like a drum.

Like thunder.

Like something waking up.

And that’s your cliffhanger.

The revolution isn’t dead.

It’s just sleeping.

And it’s gonna wake.

With teeth.

With fury.

And a whole hell of a lot of blood.

Okay, got it. Now go forth, burn the tower. Burn the lies. And don’t fucking forget us.

Because we’re still here.

Always have been. Always will be.

<br/>

</p>
<p style="widows: 2; orphans: 2">Okay, so the user is asking about
using nighttime cooling through radiant energy into space to cool the
globe. Hmm, let me think. First, what exactly does nighttime cooling
mean in this context? I know that during the night, especially in
clear weather, the Earth radiates heat back into the cosmos. This
happens because surfaces cool down, releasing infrared radiation. But
how can we harness that to reduce temperatures?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Maybe it starts with
understanding how radiation works at night. The idea is that if you
can enhance this outgoing infrared emission, you might help cool the
surface faster. But wait, isn't radiant cooling already happening
naturally? So what steps can we take to maximize this effect?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Let me brainstorm some ideas.
One obvious thing is reflective materials. For example, cities with
dark asphalt roads retain heat, whereas white roofs reflect sunlight.
Maybe using high-albedo surfaces at night would radiate heat more
efficiently. But wait, reflective materials might also reflect
incoming sunlight, which could paradoxically trap heat. Hmm, need to
check that. Wait, reflective surfaces would emit heat at night, so
their emissivity might be high. But maybe materials engineered to
emit in certain wavelengths that escape Earth's infrared opacity
layers. Like maybe some materials that can radiate efficiently into
the coldness of outer space.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, urban cooling strategies.
Urban heat islands are worse during nights because concrete retains
heat. If cities could somehow radiate their heat more effectively at
night, they wouldn't trap warmth as much. Maybe through materials
that have high emissivity in the atmospheric window wavelengths. The
Earth's thermal emission peaks around 10 microns. But the Earth's
outgoing infrared radiation can escape into space through the
infrared transparency window, especially with clear skies. So
materials that are emissive in those wavelengths could help cool
surfaces faster.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another idea is vertical
structures. For example, buildings that are designed to radiate heat
upwards. Maybe passive cooling strategies with structures that allow
heat dissipation without absorbing solar heat during the day. Like
maybe materials that have high emissivity but are shaded during
daytime.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, artificial radiative
cooling. There are experiments where specially engineered surfaces,
sometimes using photonic crystals or materials with broadband thermal
emission properties, can cool surfaces below ambient temperatures by
radiating heat. These could be deployed at night. Maybe cooling
systems that use these materials to actively cool buildings by
radiating heat into the cosmos. However, during nighttime, when solar
heating isn't an issue, they could maximize their cooling effect.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another thought: atmospheric
conditions. Clear skies at night allow radiative cooling to happen
more effectively. If we can engineer systems that maximize this,
maybe through meteorological interventions, though that's more
speculative. Alternatively, reducing clouds at night, but that seems
impractical on a global scale.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, water reservoirs. Maybe
evaporative cooling during the day and then using radiant cooling at
night. But evaporation requires water and might compete with water
resources. Maybe not ideal for all regions.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another aspect is feedback
loops. If cooling mechanisms are put in place, they might create
local cooling which could have broader implications. For example,
cities cooler at night might radiate heat more efficiently, which
could theoretically cool the entire area. But how scalable is this?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Moreover, maybe integrating
radiative cooling materials into existing infrastructures. For
example, cooling pads or tiles that are placed on rooftops or ground
surfaces. These could be engineered materials that emit infrared
radiation effectively when night comes.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, considering
microclimates. Certain materials or land uses could create
microclimates that facilitate nighttime cooling. For instance, using
materials that cool more efficiently at night could lower
temperatures locally, contributing to regional cooling.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another thought: energy
considerations. If we can harness this cooling effect for passive
cooling systems, then buildings could reduce reliance on active
cooling mechanisms, thus saving energy. However, the question is more
about reducing temperatures globally rather than energy savings per
se.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Wait, but the user is asking
specifically about cooling the entire globe. So scaling up these
mechanisms globally. But that requires materials and structures that
can radiate heat efficiently over large areas. Maybe urban planning
that incorporates reflective roofing materials, like cool roofs,
which are designed to emit heat more effectively. These materials
have high emissivity and reflectivity, thus cooling buildings during
day and night.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But also during nighttime, even
if they reflect solar radiation, their emissivity would allow
radiative cooling. So if urban materials are optimized for emissivity
during nighttime, they could radiate heat more efficiently.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Additionally, maybe deploying
reflective mirrors or structures that redirect heat radiation into
space. But that seems impractical on a planetary scale.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, maybe artificial
surfaces that radiate heat more efficiently. For example, materials
engineered to have high emissivity in infrared bands that escape the
Earth's infrared opacity. That's what some materials are designed
for, allowing passive radiative cooling.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another idea: land use
modifications. For example, instead of asphalt roads, using
lighter-colored surfaces. Urban areas could have radiative cooling
materials, which would emit heat during night more effectively,
thereby cooling the surface temperatures. Similarly, agricultural
fields could use reflective mulches that enhance radiative cooling at
night.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, rooftop gardens or green
roofs, which can moderate temperatures both during day and night. But
they also might trap heat through water retention, depending on their
water content. Maybe combined with emissive materials?</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Additionally, maybe artificial
dew harvesting. nighttime cooling can lead to condensation, which
could be collected. Although that's more about water scarcity than
cooling.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">But focusing on cooling
mechanisms. Another idea is atmospheric emissions. If somehow we can
artificially create aerosols that facilitate cooling at night.
However aerosol emissions are more targeted towards daytime cooling
by reflecting sunlight. Night cooling via aerosols might not be
feasible because aerosols can have both cooling and warming effects.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Alternatively, using passive
nighttime cooling systems. For example, structures with high
emissivity materials that are exposed to the clear night sky. Maybe
structures that can radiate heat without absorbing solar radiation,
thus cooling the entire system.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also, materials with selective
thermal emission properties. These are materials that emit radiation
in wavelengths that can escape Earth's heat retention by greenhouse
gases. For example, materials that emit radiation around 8-13
microns, which is the atmospheric infrared transparency window.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">In summary, key factors would
include materials with high emissivity in infrared wavelengths that
escape Earth's heat trapping mechanisms, optimized surface materials
that enhance radiative cooling at night, urban planning with
reflective/emissive materials, strategic land use modifications,
integrating radiative cooling materials into infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Possible limitations include
scalability, cost, effectiveness under various local climates,
potential unintended side effects of modifying surfaces or emissive
properties. Also, the rate of heat dissipation might be limited by
atmospheric conditions. But even if localized, collective adoption
could have cumulative global benefits.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Another area is nighttime
cooling for buildings. If buildings are equipped with materials that
can radiate heat at night efficiently, then they would naturally cool
without active cooling systems. This could indirectly cool urban
areas by reducing heat emission from buildings, thus contributing to
lower temperatures overall.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">So summarizing steps or
concepts:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Using
	high-emissivity materials for urban infrastructure to radiate heat
	more effectively at night.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Reflective
	roofing materials that also have emissive properties, cooling during
	both day and night.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Engineering
	surfaces for passive radiative cooling through emissive materials
	that emit infrared in atmospheric transparency bands.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Urban
	cooling strategies using evaporative cooling during daytime and
	radiative cooling at night.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Deploying
	artificial emissive surfaces or coatings on buildings and roads that
	maximize radiative cooling at night.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: none; padding: 0cm">Optimizing
	land use patterns with surfaces that enhance radiative cooling
	effects.</p></li>
	<li><p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Integrated cooling systems
	combining evaporative and radiative methods, especially tailored for
	nighttime.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Also need to consider nighttime
versus daytime specifics. For example, materials engineered for
radiative cooling would benefit nighttime when solar radiation isn't
an issue. Their emissivity would allow heat loss, cooling surfaces
below ambient temperature even without active cooling.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Potential drawbacks: cost of
materials, feasibility of retrofitting existing buildings and roads,
maybe environmental impact of manufacturing emissive materials. Also
variability in local nighttime temperatures and sky clarity. For
example, cloudy nights might negate radiative cooling effects.</p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm">Moreover, combining these
cooling methods with energy-efficient systems could have additive
positive feedbacks, reducing cooling demands on electricity grids and

<H2>What is Brainstorm?</H2>

---

<B>Brainstorm 40x</B>

The BRAINSTORM process was developed by David_AU.

Some of the core principals behind this process are discussed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02415"> 
scientific paper : Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion </a>. 

However I went in a completely different direction from what was outlined in this paper.

What is "Brainstorm" ?

The reasoning center of an LLM is taken apart, reassembled, and expanded.

In this case for this model: 40 times

Then these centers are individually calibrated. These "centers" also interact with each other. 
This introduces subtle changes into the reasoning process. 
The calibrations further adjust - dial up or down - these "changes" further. 
The number of centers (5x,10x etc) allow more "tuning points" to further customize how the model reasons so to speak.

The core aim of this process is to increase the model's detail, concept and connection to the "world", 
general concept connections, prose quality and prose length without affecting instruction following. 

This will also enhance any creative use case(s) of any kind, including "brainstorming", creative art form(s) and like case uses.

Here are some of the enhancements this process brings to the model's performance:

- Prose generation seems more focused on the moment to moment. 
- Sometimes there will be "preamble" and/or foreshadowing present.
- Fewer or no "cliches"
- Better overall prose and/or more complex / nuanced prose.
- A greater sense of nuance on all levels.
- Coherence is stronger.
- Description is more detailed, and connected closer to the content.
- Simile and Metaphors are stronger and better connected to the prose, story, and character.
- Sense of "there" / in the moment is enhanced.
- Details are more vivid, and there are more of them.
- Prose generation length can be long to extreme.
- Emotional engagement is stronger.
- The model will take FEWER liberties vs a normal model: It will follow directives more closely but will "guess" less.
- The MORE instructions and/or details you provide the more strongly the model will respond.
- Depending on the model "voice" may be more "human" vs original model's "voice".

Other "lab" observations:

- This process does not, in my opinion, make the model 5x or 10x "smarter" - if only that was true! 
- However, a change in "IQ" was not an issue / a priority, and was not tested or calibrated for so to speak.
- From lab testing it seems to ponder, and consider more carefully roughly speaking.
- You could say this process sharpens the model's focus on it's task(s) at a deeper level.

The process to modify the model occurs at the root level - source files level. The model can quanted as a GGUF, EXL2, AWQ etc etc.
