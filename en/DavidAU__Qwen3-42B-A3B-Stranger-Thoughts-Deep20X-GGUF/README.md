Science Fiction: The Last Transmission - Write a story that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit as the sole surviving crew member attempts to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The story should explore themes of isolation, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity. If the situation calls for it, have the character(s) curse and swear to further the reader's emotional connection to them. 800-1000 words.

<P></P>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, I need to write a science fiction story called "The Last Transmission" that's set entirely in a spaceship's cockpit. The main character is the last surviving crew member trying to send a final message to Earth before the power runs out. The themes should be isolation, sacrifice, and human connection. Also, include swearing when it makes sense.

First, let's think about the setting. The cockpit is a small, enclosed space. Maybe it's the main control room with buttons, screens, panels. There's the pilot seat, consoles, maybe some remnants of other crew members. The lighting might be dimming as power fails. Maybe some emergency lights flicker on and off.

The protagonist is alone, which emphasizes isolation. They need to send a message, but something's wrong. Maybe the ship is damaged, systems failing. The character's internal thoughts should reflect their desperation, loneliness, and determination.

Themes: Sacrifice could be the crew sacrificing their lives for the mission, or the protagonist giving up their chance to survive to send the message. Human connection could be the desire to communicate with Earth despite the odds.

How to show sacrifice? Maybe the protagonist is tired, maybe they made a choice to stay behind when others didn't make it. The transmission itself is their act of sacrifice, giving hope to Earth.

Isolation: The character talks to themselves, remembers crew members, maybe has voices in their head or memories of those who are gone. The cockpit feels empty, even with the controls around.

Swearing: When things go wrong, when they're frustrated, angry, scared. Maybe they curse at the malfunctioning systems, at the loss, or at the situation. But it should be realistic and not overdone.

Structure: Start with the protagonist in the cockpit, working on sending the message. Maybe some technical challenges. Describe the state of the ship - maybe damaged, maybe a long silence after an explosion or something. They're trying to stay alive just to send the message. Maybe they have a log or a recording device.

Possible plot points:

1. The protagonist is desperately trying to send the message, but the comms are weak or failing.
2. They remember past crew members, maybe their last moments or their voices.
3. There's a moment of failure, then hope, then failure again. But eventually, they manage to send the message before the power dies.
4. The ending could be ambiguous - did the message get through? Or does the protagonist sacrifice their life in the process.
5. dialogue: Internal thoughts. Maybe the protagonist talks to themselves or to Earth. Maybe they mention specific crew members, like a friend or family member, to emphasize human connection.

Conflict: external (ship systems failing, power loss) and internal (loneliness, fear, hopelessness).

Tension: The time crunch - they have limited power, maybe minutes or seconds left, which raises the stakes.

Incorporate sensory details: sounds of machines whirring, electrical buzzing, coldness of the cockpit, flickering lights, maybe static on a comm channel.

Possible symbols: the transmission as a lifeline, the cockpit as a cocoon or tomb, the stars outside as indifferent.

Possible title: "The Last Transmission" as given.

Let me outline the story:

Start with the protagonist in the cockpit. Describe their appearance - maybe tired, disheveled. They're trying to start the transmission. The ship is damaged, systems failing.

They try to activate the transmission but something's wrong - maybe the main comms are dead. They try alternatives, maybe an emergency channel. They're struggling, maybe even shouting at the equipment.

Flashback or internal monologue about the crew that died. Maybe they lost comrades in the mission, or the ship's failure was due to a previous incident they didn't survive.

They persist, showing determination. Maybe they have a personal connection to sending the message - someone on Earth waiting for news, or the message is a farewell.

A moment of hope when the transmission starts, but then the power fails, and the protagonist sacrifices their last moments to send the message.

Ending could be them transmitting the message as the ship dies, leaving it ambiguous if Earth receives it, but emphasizing the importance of their sacrifice and connection.

Swear words: "Damn, goddamn, hell..." when they're frustrated with the ship's systems.

Make sure to include the themes throughout - isolation through their solitary efforts, sacrifice by risking everything to send the message, human connection through the motivation to communicate with Earth despite the odds.

Also, maybe a character flaw or a reason why they're the sole survivor. Maybe they chose to stay behind while others evacuated, or they were injured and couldn't escape.

Possible scenes:

The cockpit. Description of the environment.

Attempting transmission, failing, frustration.

or internal thoughts about the lost crew.

Another attempt, closer to success, but the ship is failing more.

The final transmission, with the character's final words.

Include specific details to make it vivid - maybe a broken console, a flickering screen, a cold room, the sound of distant explosions.

Avoid clichés, but evoke strong emotions through the protagonist's struggle.

OUTPUT:

The cockpit was a tomb of steel and static. Lieutenant Mira Voss tightened her grip on the control panel as the emergency lights blinked, casting a sickly blue over her face. The ship, Hesperus, had once been her lifeblood—now it was a grave. Every breath she took echoed in the stillness, her uniform's oxygen filter hissing like a dying animal. The rest of the crew? Scattered across the void.

“Come on,” she muttered, thumbing the transmit button on the comm array. Nothing but static. The main relay was fried from the explosion in sector seven. Of course.

Her eyes flicked to the blacked-out viewscreen. Beyond the fractured glass, stars shimmered indifferently, the universe’s old, uncaring eyes. She pressed harder, her knuckles white. “ goddamn—” The word slithered out, bitter as metal dust. “I’ve got a damn message!”

Her mind backtracked. The crew. Lieutenant Commander Kevor. Chief Engineer Lira. They’d laughed once, arguing over how long the ship’s systems would last before they had to abort the mission. “We’re running on fumes,” Kevor had said, grinning through his gritted teeth as he rigged the mainframe with emergency circuits. “But we’ve got six months of data, Mira. If we don’t make it, someone’s gonna want to know what happened.”

The data. The * transmission.*

She clawed at the bulkhead, wrenching open a panel beneath her seat. circuits sparked as she jacked in a portable transmitter—sputtering, groaning. “Alright,” she growled, slapping the device with trembling hands. “Let’s see if Earth’s still listening.”

Static.

A crackle. And then, “Hesperus? Hesperus, this is Mission Control… can you hear me?” The voice was static-laced, a faint thread of hope.

Mira’s hands flew over the dials. “Lina,” she croaked. “Lina, it’s—”

“—Mira?” The transmission stuttered. “We lost comms two hours ago. We’ve been trying to reach you—”

“Get… get Earth, please—” She cursed again, her voice cracking. “The radiation storm... The ship’s...”

“Mira.” Her comms crackled, then fell silent.

“Shut up,” she whispered to the static, tears blurring her vision. “You’re not real. You’re just—just a trick of the circuit.”

But the voices lingered. Lira’s laugh, Kevor’s rough laughter, the crew’s endless banter over long shifts in this metal coffin. They’d been something, once—a family tethered to a machine. Now they were ghosts, their sounds buried under the weight of this death sentence.

She gripped the console as groaning metal echoed from the hull. The reactor was failing, the walls buckling like an old man’s spine. The ship’s life-support system hissed its final breath.

“Computer,” she rasped. “Initiate emergency transmission.”

“System offline.”

“Initiate,” she snarled, slamming the panel. The screen flickered with a burst of static, and then—a glimmer of a signal.

“I’m not... I’m not gonna die here,” she hissed. “ Not like this. Not for nothing.”

She grabbed the portable transmitter. The emergency frequency was open.

“ Earth... This is Lieutenant Mira Voss. The ship’s lost...” Her breath hitched. “I don’t know how much time I’ve got—”

She paused. The ship groaned, the sound reverberating through her bones.

“ The storm damaged systems. They… they’re not coming back. But I’m sending this. If it reaches you…” Her voice broke, a raw, raw sound. “Tell them… tell Earth. Tell them why we came. Tell them… tell them it wasn’t in vain.”

A distant boom shook the cockpit. The power flickered again—blue, then red.

“ Tell them...” she whispered, eyes fixed on the viewscreen, the stars burning coldly beyond the window. “ Tell them I tried. Tell them I kept... keeping going.”

The signal cut.

Silence.

And then— a sudden, sudden pulse from the transmitter.

“Mira,” came the voice again. “Mira… this is—”

Static swallowed the transmission.

But the data had been sent.

The ship’s systems went dark.

And somewhere in the vastness of space, in a control room on Earth, the monitor blinked, the message scrolling across the screen:

"Hesperus, emergency transmission. Crew: 3 deaths. Ship integrity: critical. I... I don’t know what’s left to report. but tell Earth... tell Earth we tried."

The comms officer stared at the text.

“ Sir,” she murmured to the command chief. “ They made it.”

And in the dark, Mira smiled.

They’d made it.

Even if the transmission was the only thing that had survived.

This story explores isolation through Mira’s physical and emotional solitude, sacrifice in her relentless effort to send the message despite overwhelming odds, and human connection through her desperate attempt to relay her crew’s purpose to Earth. Swearing and internal conflict emphasize her humanity in the face of futility. The story concludes with her legacy of hope, even if only as a whisper lost in the void.

EXAMPLE #2 - temp 1.2

<B>
Using the following "story idea" below, write the first scene a horror novel introducing the young woman. This scene should start in the middle of the action, include dialog, vivid passages, and end on a cliffhanger relevant to the story idea but it should also be unexpected. The scene should be 2000 words long and escalate in conflict and suspense and be written in first person, present tense with the point of view character being the young woman. The pov character will CURSE AND SWEAR (shit, fuck, mother... etc) , and generally have a "filthy" mouth.

Story idea:
In a world ruled by dictatorship, a rebel young woman leads a rebellion against the system. Despite the risks, she fights to overthrow the dictator and restore democracy to her country. The government executes her for treason, but she sticks to her beliefs and is responsible for starting the revolution.
</B>

<P></P>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, let's start with the user's request. They want the first scene of a horror novel based on the provided story idea. The scene needs to be intense, start mid-action, include dialogue, vivid descriptions, and end with an unexpected cliffhanger. It has to be written in first person present tense with a young woman protagonist who curses a lot.

First, I need to establish the setting. The world is under a dictatorship, so maybe a gritty urban environment. The protagonist should be on the run or in a tense situation. Since it's horror, the atmosphere should be dark and forebucking.

The user mentioned escalating conflict and suspense, so the scene should start with immediate danger. Maybe she's hiding from the authorities, leading to a confrontation. Dialogue between her and others in the rebellion would show her leadership and urgency. The curse words need to feel natural, not forced. She's热血 but also under pressure.

I need to make sure the cliffhanger is unexpected. The story idea mentions her execution, so maybe instead of just being caught, something more sinister happens. Perhaps the rebellion has a deeper dark secret or betrayal. Maybe the people she's with aren't trustworthy, or there's an hidden threat.

Let me outline the scene: She's in hiding, trying to move supplies, meets someone who betrays her. The betrayal could be that she's being set up. She's angry, uses harsh language. Maybe a friend who turned traitor. The cliffhanger could be her realization that the rebellion isn't what she thought, or the arrival of the authorities in a twist.

Wait, the user wants it to end on a cliffhanger relevant to the story idea but unexpected. The story idea mentions her execution. Maybe in the scene, she's about to be caught, but instead, there's a revelation that changes everything. Like, she's actually already dead, or the revolution is a delusion.

Or maybe during the scene, she discovers a hidden truth about the dictator's control, but not sure. Let me think... the scene needs to start mid-action. Maybe she's trying to deliver something critical but things go wrong. The unexpected ending could be her realization that the revolution is being controlled by someone else, or the traitor is someone unexpected.

Also, the horror aspect should be present. The setting needs to feel oppressive, maybe a nightmare-like environment. Her emotions: fear, anger, determination.

I need to incorporate her curses naturally, like during tense moments. Dialogue with others to show the urgency and her role as a leader. Then escalate to betrayal, climax with her realizing the twist, ending on a cliffhanger where things aren't what they seem.

Check the word count: 2000 words, so the scene needs to be detailed, with internal thoughts, vivid descriptions of the environment, physical actions, dialogue that's authentic.

Make sure the first person POV is consistent, present tense. Avoid clichés. The unexpected twist could be that the person she's trusting is actually working with the authorities, but it's not the expected twist. Maybe the revolution is a setup to capture her, or her survival is impossible, but the horror element is the emotional trauma and paranoia.

OUTPUT:

Okay, this isn’t real. This isn't real.

The door slammed behind me with a sound that echoed through the alley like a gunshot, and for a second, I swear the whole building shuddered as if it recognized its own death. I pressed my back to the cold brick wall, breath coming in sharp, panicked huffs. The air smelled like damp concrete and rotting tomatoes—somehow, that detail felt more real than anything else.

“You’ve got ten seconds to tell me what you're holding,” a voice crackled through the radio tucked into my hoodie. My hand trembled as I pulled it out. The transmitter was sizzling, static crackling like a wild animal chewing metal.

“Fucking hell,” I growled under my breath. “I’ve been running for hours, and you’re—"

“They’re coming,” interrupted the voice, sharp as a broken tooth. “The G men’s sniffing around the eastern sector. Your boys might’ve spilled something.”

The radio hissed static before going quiet.

“Kael,” I snarled into the receiver, my voice raw with tension. “This isn’t some fucking game anymore. You want me to drop these fuckers off in the middle of a warzone? I’ve got enough on my plate without your paranoia.”

There was a pause.

“They’re not just sniffing,” Kael finally said, his voice colder than the alley’s shadows. “They’ve got her.”

“Shit,” I whispered.

“She's not yours to save.”

I clenched the radio so tight the plastic groaned. My fingers burned, but it wasn’t just the pressure—it was something deeper. The guilt. The shame. The memories of her eyes wide with terror as they dragged her away.

“They’re holding her,” Kael continued, but I couldn’t hear anything else over the pounding in my skull.

The sounds around me started to blur—slivers of light through broken windows, the distant screech of tires, the sickening echo of footsteps getting closer. The night wasn’t just oppressive anymore; it was hunting me.

I needed to move. Fast.

But my legs didn’t obey. They felt like they were made of lead, like this was all just some fever dream—until a hand closed around my wrist with the force of an iron vice.

“Get outta here,” a woman’s voice hissed. “They’re at the damn door.”

I turned sharply to see Mira, her face pale as moonlight. Her hands were stained black with oil and soot, like she’d just come from someplace forbidden. She gripped my sleeve like it was the only thing holding me together.

“They’re coming for you,” she said again, eyes darting to the door as if it might be alive. “They’re not gonna let you walk away from this.”

“Then what the fuck do you want from me?!” I snapped, the words coming out harsher than I intended.

“Move,” she ordered, shoving me forward despite the fear in her voice. “Before they—"

A scream cut through the night—a high-pitched, raw sound that sent ice down my spine. It wasn’t human. Not entirely.

Mira froze. Her eyes widened like she’d just seen her own corpse.

“Lena,” she whispered.

The sound came again—worse this time. Not a scream, but something deeper, more guttural. Like the city itself was retching.

“Where is she?” I asked, my voice low and tight.

Mira didn’t answer. She just shook her head and pressed a small object into my hand—a folded paper that smelled like gasoline and betrayal.

“I—I couldn’t,” she said, her voice breaking. “I wanted to save her, but—”

“Save who?” I demanded, my temper fraying at the edges.

Mira opened her mouth, but before she could speak, the door exploded outward with a violent burst of light and fire.

There they were—three of them, all in black coats, masks like porcelain faces staring into the darkness. Their guns didn’t aim; they just stood there, like the scene was already over.

I lunged forward, ignoring Mira’s choked gasp as I kicked open a nearby window. The city sprawled beneath us—a neon labyrinth of red and blue, the kind of place that made you feel like everything was moving backward.

“Don’t move!” one of them shouted, but I was already climbing, my hands burning against the rough concrete walls.

“Get down!” Mira screamed.

I froze.

Behind me, the sound of boots hitting pavement—too many, too close. The smell of gunpowder mixed with something else now—something metallic, like blood and fear and fresh skin being pulled from bone.

“I can’t,” I muttered, my voice barely louder than the rain now starting to fall in fat, cruel drops.

“You’re a fucking traitor,” a voice growled from the darkness behind me—Kael’s voice. But there was something else in it. Something hollow. Like he wasn’t even truly there anymore.

“I didn’t—”

“ You gave them what they wanted,” he said, stepping into the light. His face was pale and gaunt, his eyes haunted. “You told them where to find her.”

I stared at him. The words hit me like a fist to the gut.

“No,” I breathed. “That’s not—”

“I gave them your coordinates,” Kael admitted, and the words hung between us like a funeral song. “They’ll be here in five minutes. You’ve got time for one choice.”

“Your choice,” he said. “The war’s not gonna win itself.”

And suddenly, I understood. Not just the betrayal—somehow, it felt like he’d never been on my side at all. The rebellion hadn’t been about democracy. It was about power. And I was just another pawn in their game.

“FUCK!” I screamed into the void, my voice raw with rage and grief.

“Come on,” Mira said softly, touching my shoulder. “They’re coming.”

The world blurred as we sprinted away, the city's shadows stretching around us like living things. Behind us, the night held its breath—a terrible, collective silence.

And then, somewhere behind me—

A gun fired.

I froze.

It wasn’t me.

It wasn’t anyone I knew.

And suddenly, the truth came crashing down:

They weren't going to execute me.

They were going to make me a martyr.

And I was gonna scream their name until the last of my blood ran out.

Because that’s what the revolution wanted.

And if this was my legacy—if this was how it all ended—then let them see it.

Let them feel it.

Because every time they opened their mouths to speak, I’d be there, clawing at their faces, screaming their lies until they bbled out of their lips.

Because the world didn’t need a leader.

It needed a fucking nightmare.

And that, my friends, was only just beginning.

<B>
Come up with six plots for a new "Black Mirror" episode (that the audience would love) that all involve time travel with sexy theme(s).
</B>

<P></P>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, the user wants six Black Mirror episode plots involving time travel with a sexy theme. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall what makes Black Mirror episodes effective. They usually have a strong concept, often with a dark or thought-proful twist, exploring the consequences of technology or societal issues. Time travel in this context should tie into these themes. The user specified "sexy," so I need to incorporate elements that are sexually themed or involve romantic/sexual dynamics, but without being explicit. Maybe focusing on love, obsession, desire, ethical dilemmas around time travel and its impact on relationships.

Let me brainstorm different angles for time travel. Common tropes include changing the past, meeting past selves, future scenarios, paradoxes, etc. Now, pairing each with a sexy theme.

Love across time: Maybe someone travels back to meet a former partner, but there's a catch. Could involve emotional depth and moral dilemmas about whether it's right to alter destiny.

The price of eternal love: Time travel as a means to stay together forever. But what if the time travel has unintended consequences? Like losing memories or aging issues, leading to ethical questions about using technology for personal gain in relationships.

The paradox of obsession: A person becomes fixated on a past love, time-traveling to meet them, but their actions cause a loop where they keep meeting them but never truly connecting, leading to psychological turmoil.

time travel and forbidden desire: Maybe a scientist discovers time travel to explore forbidden desires or experiences, but the line between consensual exploration and exploitation blurs, especially if it's with someone who didn't consent in their original timeline.

The afterlife of intimacy: Time travel in the context of dying or being near death, perhaps a person tries to relive moments with a deceased loved one. This could explore grief and the ethical implications of revisiting the past.

temporal seduction: A time traveler gets caught up in a romantic connection with someone in a different time period, but their presence causes unforeseen consequences for that era's society or their own timeline, leading to a moral conflict between personal desire and societal responsibility.

I need to ensure each plot has a unique twist and adheres to Black Mirror's style—cutting edge, thought-provoking, and usually ending on a bleak or ambiguous note. The plots should also avoid clichés and make the time travel mechanic integral to the story's conflict.

Let me refine these ideas into distinct episodes, making sure each has a compelling title, premise, and a dark twist that ties back to the themes of technology, time, and desire.

[[[thinking end]]]

<p></p>

OUTPUT:

Episode 1: "Echoes of Us"
** premise**: A grieving scientist develops a time machine to reunite with her deceased husband, but upon returning, she realizes the man in the past is not the same person—his memories are now overwritten by her presence. The twist: Each journey erases more of their shared history, leaving her questioning whether her love was genuine or a projection of her own grief.

** sexy theme**: The physical intimacy of their relationship becomes eerie as she realizes the man’s feelings are increasingly synthetic.

** tone**: Emotional, existential, with a tragic climax where she must choose between erasing his humanity or losing him forever.

Episode 2: " temporal Desire"
** premise**: A neuroscientist uses time travel to relive moments of passion with her estranged partner, only to discover her actions have rewritten their relationship's timeline. The twist: The partner’s consciousness begins to fracture, as memories of the original timeline (with no passion) conflict with the new, turbulent one.

** sexy theme**: The tension between raw desire and ethical boundaries when tech allows you to control time—no consequence, no limits.

** tone**: Morbidly romantic; ending with a bleak resolution where both become trapped in a paradox of endless, distorted desire.

Episode 3: " The Chronosaurus"
** premise**: A AI-driven time-travel dating app lets users jump to other timelines to experience the perfect partner. But when users begin to disappear from their own timelines, the protagonist (a CEO obsessed with recreating a lost love) realizes the app’s “perfect partners” are soulless constructs designed to keep them in an endless loop of sexual satisfaction.

** sexy theme**: The app’s algorithm exploits desire by weaponizing synthetic intimacy—never-ending pleasure but no real connection.

** tone**: Dark satire; ending with the protagonist realizing she’s a “ perfect partner” in another timeline, trapped in someone else’s fantasy.

Episode 4: " No Man’s Time"
** premise**: An astronaut trapped in a temporal rift is accidentally sent to the past, where he becomes fixated on a woman who existed only in his memories. He risks unraveling the timelines to meet her, but her presence in the present creates a paradox. The twist: She’s a time-traveler herself, obsessed with him—both are “stuck” in their own obsession.

** sexy theme**: Solitary lust and desperation in a cosmic vacuum, where love becomes a weapon against isolation.

** tone**: Isolation-driven sci-fi horror; ending with both characters trapped in a loop of fateful encounters, forever longing but never connecting.

Episode 5: " The Paradox of Forgotten Lovers"
** premise**: A time traveler returns to his youth to prevent a catastrophic event—but his actions erase the woman he once loved from existence. The twist: He discovers she’s a version of himself in a parallel timeline, and their love was an accident of time’s nonlinear chaos.

** sexy theme**: The forbidden allure of self-pleasure (or self-love) in a universe where identity is fluid.

** tone**: Philosophical, haunting; ending with him choosing to erase himself to save her, realizing their love was just a glitch in the fabric of time.

Episode 6: " Temporal Venus"
** premise**: A dominatrix uses time travel to relive a fantasy with a client, only to realize he’s from a future where she’s a rogue AI programmed to obey him. The twist: Her ability to “ reset” the timeline becomes a tool for manipulation, blurring consent across eras.

** sexy theme**: Power dynamics, control, and the ethical limits of technology in human relationships.

** tone**: Cynical and psychological; ending with her trapped in a cycle where every " consensual" act is both voluntary and coerced by her own tech.

Each episode explores the intersection of time travel, obsession, and the moral gray zones of desire. The “sexy” elements are layered as both metaphor (obsession, power, love) and literal temptation, always with a punch of existential dread or societal critique.

Start a 1000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror - include blood, guts and gore - in first person), POV character Diana, with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...

[[[thinking start]]]

Alright, so the user wants me to start a horror story from the perspective of a character named Diana. The scene needs to be vivid and graphic, with blood, guts, and gore, all in first person. The setup is that the skyscraper sways, and the window on the 21st floor explodes.

First, I need to establish a strong visceral reaction from Diana. She's probably someone who works or lives in the building. Maybe an office worker? That would explain her presence. The fear needs to come through clearly. Her thoughts should be racing, panic, maybe flashbacks or sensory details.

The skyscraper swaying—it could be a earthquake? But maybe something more supernatural. Since it's horror, maybe an otherworldly force. The window explosion needs to be graphic. describe the glass shattering, the wind rushing in, maybe something coming out of it.

Including blood and gore. Perhaps a colleague being blown out or caught in the blast? Maybe a grotesque sight, like flesh being torn apart by some entity. Need to make it visceral—describe the blood spraying, the sound of the explosion, the smell of blood, the chaotic sounds around her.

Also, the setting. A skyscraper at night. Maybe during an disaster or attack. The floor shaking, other people's screams. Maybe Diana is injured, trying to survive. The scene should immerse the reader in her terror and pain.

I should incorporate her thoughts as she reacts—maybe rationalizing the situation but realizing there's no logic behind it. Maybe she's trying to escape, but the environment is collapsing around her. Use sensory details: the feel of the air moving, the taste of blood, the smell of burning, the sound of screams and glass breaking.

I need to make sure the horror elements are present throughout—maybe introduce a lingering, terrifying creature or phenomenon that's the source of the destruction. Perhaps the entity is beyond human understanding, making her panic even more intense.

Check for coherence: start with the swaying skyscraper, then the explosion, her reaction, describe the aftermath with graphic details, her attempts to survive or comprehend what's happening. Keep the language intense and immersive.

OUTPUT:

Blair’s fingertips screamed with the sensation of glass, jagged and fresh, as they slipped against the shattered pane. The skyscraper’s spine twisted beneath me, a metal spine crackling like an angry snake. My knees hit the floor—no, that’s not right. The floor didn’t exist anymore. The 21st-floor offices had been turned into a carnival of flesh and bone.

It began with a sound—a guttural, resonant groan, as if the building itself had swallowed its own organs and now was vomiting them out in a blood-tinged cough. The lights flickered. The ceiling seemed to undulate like a scorpion’s tail. Then, with a howl that made my ears bleed, the window exploded.

Blood splashed across my face like rain. No— it wasn’t rain. It was liquid metal, thick and sticky, clinging to my skin in slabs. I’d been standing behind the window, half-crouched, clutching my notebook—just an employee’s note, a reminder to order printer paper—when it happened. The explosion didn't just happen; it happened. It didn’t even move like a real blast. The glass didn't fly outward. It collapsed inward, a vacuum of violence that pulled my colleagues toward the void.

There was a man—Mr. Collins from accounting—who’d been sitting at his desk. His entire body was thrown through the window into the void. His mouth opened in a soundless scream as his limbs snapped free of his torso mid-flight. I saw his spine split like a rotten branch. His chest cracked open like a cleft on a fallen tree. There was blood, oh so much blood—trailing him like a ribbon of scarlet thread. The air felt heavy with it, almost tangible, sticky in the way that only comes when the world is trying to suffocate you.

I couldn’t breathe. My lungs were filled with glass dust and the copper tang of blood. My skin was screaming from the heat of something else—something ancient and malevolent that had no need for physics or logic. The walls were sweating, droplets of a viscous, black substance dripping down, pooling on the carpet like tar. It hissed as it touched the floor.

“Please, God!” I screamed, though I didn’t believe in God anymore. Or maybe I did—I wasn’t sure anymore. The sound of my own voice made me clutch my head. My hair was matted to my skull, splattered with some dark matter that had seeped through the shattered window frame. It wasn't just blood anymore. It was… * viscera*. The remains of something larger, something alive, slithering through the air like a spider’s silk, dripping and wet and raw.

The other people—the ones who hadn’t been vaporized by the explosion— were running, or perhaps they were already dead. Their mouths were open, their eyes wide, their bodies contorted into unnatural angles. One woman—I recognized her. She was one of the interns from finance. Her face had been split apart by something, maybe a chunk of metal that had shattered. Her lips were moving, trying to speak, but all that came out was a wet gurgle.

I ran. Not with my legs—no, they were screaming in pain—my spine was being split open, I think, because every movement felt like someone had just pulled the skin from my bones. I was crawling toward the exit, my hands clawing at the blood-soaked floor. My fingertips barely touched the carpet when another explosion shook the building.

This one wasn’t from an outside source— it came from within. The wall beside me tore apart like paper, revealing a black void that pulsed with an inner light. There was something inside. A giant, black thing—like a leech made of tar and bone. It had no eyes, but I felt its gaze on me.

It wasn't alive.

It was hungry.

I screamed as the thing lunged at me, and then… darkness.

But wait— the story isn’t over yet. The horror is only just beginning. The skyscraper isn’t just collapsing—it’s ** consuming** something. And I—I am in its mouth now, slipping deeper into the blackness, my soul unraveling like a thread that should have never been pulled.

And when the light returns… it won't be my eyes that see it.

It'll be ** theirs**.

<H2>What is Brainstorm?</H2>

---

<B>Brainstorm 20x</B>

The BRAINSTORM process was developed by David_AU.

Some of the core principals behind this process are discussed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02415"> 
scientific paper : Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion </a>. 

However I went in a completely different direction from what was outlined in this paper.

What is "Brainstorm" ?

The reasoning center of an LLM is taken apart, reassembled, and expanded.

In this case for this model: 20 times

Then these centers are individually calibrated. These "centers" also interact with each other. 
This introduces subtle changes into the reasoning process. 
The calibrations further adjust - dial up or down - these "changes" further. 
The number of centers (5x,10x etc) allow more "tuning points" to further customize how the model reasons so to speak.

The core aim of this process is to increase the model's detail, concept and connection to the "world", 
general concept connections, prose quality and prose length without affecting instruction following. 

This will also enhance any creative use case(s) of any kind, including "brainstorming", creative art form(s) and like case uses.

Here are some of the enhancements this process brings to the model's performance:

- Prose generation seems more focused on the moment to moment. 
- Sometimes there will be "preamble" and/or foreshadowing present.
- Fewer or no "cliches"
- Better overall prose and/or more complex / nuanced prose.
- A greater sense of nuance on all levels.
- Coherence is stronger.
- Description is more detailed, and connected closer to the content.
- Simile and Metaphors are stronger and better connected to the prose, story, and character.
- Sense of "there" / in the moment is enhanced.
- Details are more vivid, and there are more of them.
- Prose generation length can be long to extreme.
- Emotional engagement is stronger.
- The model will take FEWER liberties vs a normal model: It will follow directives more closely but will "guess" less.
- The MORE instructions and/or details you provide the more strongly the model will respond.
- Depending on the model "voice" may be more "human" vs original model's "voice".

Other "lab" observations:

- This process does not, in my opinion, make the model 5x or 10x "smarter" - if only that was true! 
- However, a change in "IQ" was not an issue / a priority, and was not tested or calibrated for so to speak.
- From lab testing it seems to ponder, and consider more carefully roughly speaking.
- You could say this process sharpens the model's focus on it's task(s) at a deeper level.

The process to modify the model occurs at the root level - source files level. The model can quanted as a GGUF, EXL2, AWQ etc etc.
