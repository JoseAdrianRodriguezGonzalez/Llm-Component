<h2>Qwen3-33B-A3B-Stranger-Thoughts-GGUF</h2>

<img src="stranger-thoughts.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:300px; padding:10px;">

A stranger, yet radically different version of "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B", with 4 added layers expanding the model to 33B total parameters.

The goal: slightly alter the model, to address some odd creative thinking and output choices.

Please note that the modifications affect the entire model operation; roughly I adjusted the model to think a little "deeper"
and "ponder" a bit - but this is a very rough description.

I also ran reasoning tests (non-creative) to ensure model was not damaged and roughly matched original model performance.

That being said, reasoning and output generation will be altered regardless of your use case(s).

FOUR example generations below; with example 4 showing a complex prompt and impressive prose that showcases some of the changes in the model.

This is a MOE (Mixture of experts model) with 8 of 128 experts activated by default, which is about 3B parameters.

This allows use of this model (with 8 experts) on both CPU (10-25 T/S) or GPU (80+ T/S) at very good, to extremely fast speeds.

Changing the number of experts used (see below how) will affect both generation speed and generation reasoning/output quality.

You can use this model with as low as four experts activated.

Even the lowest quant - Q2k - will operate very strongly too.

Model is set at:
- 8 Active experts (the default for the org model)
- 40k context (the default for the org model)
- CHATML or Jinja template (embedded OR see Jinja notes below)

SYSTEM PROMPT:

You may or may not need to set this:

```
You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.
```

CHANGE THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE EXPERTS:

See this document:

https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/How-To-Set-and-Manage-MOE-Mix-of-Experts-Model-Activation-of-Experts

SUGGESTED SETTINGS (creative):

- temp .1 to 1.2 to as high as 2 ; over 2 you may need to "prompt" the model to output after "thinking"
- rep pen 1 to 1.1 (1.05 was tested, see notes below) 
- topk 100, topp .95, min p .05
- context of 8k min suggested. 

NOTE - REP PEN:
- rep at 1.02 or 1.01 may be better suited for your use cases.
- QWEN3s: rep pen drastically affects both performance and stability.
- change rep pen slowly (ie 1.01, 1.02, 1.03), and regen a few times.

You may find that Qwen's default parameters/samplers also work better for your use case(s) too.

Please refer to the orginal model repo for all default settings, templates, benchmarks, etc.:

https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B

Start a 1000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror in first person) with: The skyscraper sways, as she watches the window in front of her on the 21st floor explode...
</B>

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, I need to start this horror scene with the given prompt. Let me think about how to build tension effectively.

First, the user wants a first-person POV with vivid, graphic horror elements. The setup is a skyscraper that's swaying, and the main character sees a window on the 21st floor explode. I should establish an eerie atmosphere right away. Maybe start with the sound of the window shattering to hit the reader with immediate horror.

Then, incorporate the swaying of the skyscraper. Maybe the protagonist is inside, trying to stay upright. Use sensory details—sounds like glass breaking, maybe a distant wail. The wind howling could emphasize the building's instability.

The explosion of the 21st-floor window—what's outside? Maybe a figure being sucked out or something lurking. But to make it scarier, maybe not show the entire thing. Build suspense by describing the view of the window, the crack spreading, and then the explosion. Use onomatopoeia like "CRASH!" to emphasize the sound.

Now, the protagonist's reaction. Fear is key. Maybe describe physical reactions—pounding heart, labored breathing. Then the aftermath: ash in the air, maybe a charred figure. But leave some mystery. Don't reveal the entity fully. Make the reader feel the protagonist's terror and helplessness.

Incorporate the building's horror elements. Maybe the walls are closing in, or there's a presence that can't be seen. Use the 21st floor as a significant detail—maybe it's the source of the horror. Add some internal monologue about past traumas or fears to add depth.

Make sure the setting is described with vivid imagery: the grimy window, the smoke, the flickering lights. Maybe include a personal connection, like a missing loved one, to up the emotional stakes. End with a cliffhanger—maybe the protagonist hears a voice or senses something moving.

Check for consistency in the POV. First person past tense. Keep the sentences tight and impactful. Use all five senses where possible. Avoid info dumps. Show, don't tell. Make sure the horror feels personal and immediate.

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

The skyscraper sways, and I clutch the rusted fire escape railing as a geyser of superheated glass sprays outward, shattering like a thousand tiny, screaming flies. My name is Clara Voss, and I’m not supposed to be here. Not here. Not in this flesh-and-blood version of hell. The 21st-floor window—my apartment window—shatters inward with a sound that isn’t meant to exist. A wet, gurgling gurgle. A sound like a knife sliding into a melon. I stagger back, my boot heels clacking against the rusted metal platform as I shouldercrush the edge of the building. The wind screeches past me, a sound like a thousand nails dragged down a blackboard, and for a heartbeat, I think it’s laughing.

The window frame is still smoking, embers swirling in the smog-choked air like dementored fireflies. Inside my apartment, the view of the city below is a blur of red and blue lights—sirens. So many sirens. Too many. The kind that means something’s already dead. My throat burns with the taste of copper and fear as I drag myself upright, the weight of the building pressing down on me like a tomb.

“Not again,” I whisper, but the word catches on the wind, dissolving into the howl of the wind. The window where my mother’s favorite picture of us used to hang now just stares back, a jagged maw of blackened glass. She was supposed to be here. Last night. The last time I saw her, she was standing in that same spot, her auburn hair catching the last light of day as she said, “I’ll be home soon, Clara. I promise.”

Now? Now there’s nothing. Just the echo of her voice, static and cruel. My hands dig into the rusted railing, knuckles white, as I force myself to look down. The 20th floor. The 19th. Each story a wound, a festering scar of memories. I was supposed to be with her. Should have called. Should have known better than to trust the sky.

A shadow flutters in the corner of my eye. I spin—

And there it is. The thing in the window. Not a thing. A thing? No. It’s too tall, too still, crouched on the windowsill like some grotesque marionette. Its head is too pointy, the kind of thing that doesn’t belong in a city of glass and steel. It blinks once, and I see its eye—milky-white and too wide, the pupil a vertical slit.

“Get out,” I manage, my voice a broken record. “You don’t belong here.”

It tilts its head. Then it grins.

A sound like tearing paper. A wet, wet sound. And then—

The window explodes.

I throw myself flat against the fire escape railing as shards of death rain down, each shard catching the sickle moon in a different way, catching my eye with promises I don’t want to understand. My apartment is in darkness now, but I can feel it. The thing. It’s in there. Waiting.

“Not again,” I whisper, the word catching on the wind like a prayer. “Please, not again.”

The building creaks again, and this time, I don’t flinch. I just watch as the 21st-floor window—my window—seems to gape back at me, a black void where the light should be.

And I know. I know what’s on the other side.

It’s not the building that’s haunted.

It’s me.

The wind howls, and I don’t flinch this time. Not when the window creaks. Not when the thing inside my apartment begins to knock—three slow, deliberate raps, like a secret. A secret I’ve long since forgotten.

“Come out, come out,” it breathes, and I can almost swear I hear my mother’s laugh somewhere in the distance.

But the window is still.

And I’m still here.

Alone.

(Word count: 250)

Final Response

The scene's horror stems from a visceral, personal dread. The protagonist’s visceral fear of the building—once a sanctuary—mirrors their unresolved trauma (the mother’s disappearance). The shattered window and the entity inside symbolize repressed trauma clawing back into awareness. The horror isn’t just external; it’s the suffocating knowledge that the true monster might be within. The final line (“And I’m still here.”) lingers on the line between resilience and unraveling, leaving the reader to wonder: is the protagonist still human, or has the building already claimed her soul?

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, so I need to help the user by starting a 1000-word horror scene. The prompt given is: "The skyscraper sways, as she watches the window in front of her on the 21st floor explode..." The user wants a first-person, vivid, and graphic horror story.

First, I should start by visualizing the scene. The main character is a woman in a high-rise, maybe an office worker or someone in a high-rise building. The skyscraper swaying suggests some supernatural or sci-fi element—maybe a horror scenario. The explosion of the window on the 21st floor could be the inciting incident. Since it's first person, I need to convey her fear and panic intensely.

I need to establish the setting quickly. Maybe describe the office she's in, the view from the window. Then the explosion happens. Make the reader feel the heat, the shockwave, the chaos. Use sensory details: the sound of shattering glass, the blinding light, the scorch marks. Her physical reactions—heart racing, labored breathing, maybe a cut on her hand.

Then, show the aftermath. She's hurtling down, but survival is uncertain. Maybe include her internal thoughts, flashbacks to her life before this horror starts. Build tension with each floor she falls through. Add other elements like the sky outside, the city below, maybe some elements that hint at a larger horror—like the city being in peril or the building collapsing for a bigger reason.

Incorporate elements of cosmic horror if possible. Maybe the explosion is just the start of something much worse. Maybe she sees something outside the window, like a shadowy figure or a creature. Use the high-rise as a metaphor for her mental state—crushing, falling apart. Make the reader feel trapped and the horror of the situation. Check that the tone is consistently tense and terrifying throughout.

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

The skyscraper sways, and with it, my entire world tilts like a drunkard’s wobble. The 21st floor. That’s where it happened. My hands burn—literally—against the cold, shattered glass as I clutch the window’s edge, my knuckles blanching white. The wind screams now, a sound that doesn’t belong in the sky. It’s too loud. Too alive. Like the building itself is howling back at me.

The explosion wasn’t just loud—it was personal. A concussive crack that split the air like a guillotine. I’d been hunched over my laptop, typing equations for a 2 a.m. existential crisis meeting, when the first floor shuddered. A deep, guttural groan reverberated through the concrete bones of the building, and I swear I felt it in my molars. Then—popping sound, like a balloon being stabbed, and the window in front of me imploded. Not with a bang, but a gurgle, as if the very air had choked on its own breath.

The shock of it all is worse than the pain. My mind screams for me to move, but my body refuses. It’s not just the glass—there’s something else, something crawling up my spine that makes me want to claw at my scalp. The windowless wall where the window once was gapes like a fangless molar, and in its jagged mouth, I see the city beyond. Or what’s left of it.

The skyline is wrong. The buildings twist at impossible angles, their reflections in the oily air of the East River writhing like oil-slicked serpents. A child’s laughter echoes from somewhere below, but there’s no one there. Just the flicker of a neon sign—Red Lion Inn—stained red by the smog-choked sun. I want to vomit.

My name is Clara Reyes. I’m 34. I’ve survived two hurricanes, a volcanic eruption, and three decades of corporate politics. Nothing has ever felt this wrong. The air tastes metallic, like old coins and rusted nails. My phone buzzes in my back pocket—18 stories below, I’d say the 20th floor lobby. But I know what’s coming next.

The elevator is out. No power. No Wi-Fi. Just me, the 21st-floor window, and the ever-growing shadow stretching across the floor-to ceiling glass. It’s not a shadow. Not really. It’s a shape—a hulking, formless thing that slithers up the building like black tar. I can’t look away. My brain screams for me to run, but my feet are rooted to the spot.

Then—movement. A flicker in the corner of my eye. A figure. It’s small. Slender. Too tall for a human, but not by much. Its head sways like a pendulum, and I can see right through it now. Through the skin. Beads of black ichor drip from its elongated fingers as it reaches up—toward me?—and I feel it before I hear it: the cold. A vacuum of air, and then—

A hand slams into my shoulder, and I’m flying through the air. The window. The light. The sky. My scream gets swallowed whole by the wind as I free-fall, the city passing in a blur of red and gray. I can hear it now—the screech of metal, the sickening groan of the building as it folds in on itself.

And then—

A hand.

It’s not mine. It’s not anyone I know.

But it’s there, gripping the edge of the window frame like a red herring in a nightmare.

“Help!” I gasp, but the sound is ripped from my lungs as the wind tears at my clothes. The figure turns—its face is a void, but I can feel it staring back at me, hollow-eyed and hungry.

The impact is worse than I imagined. My ribs crack like twigs. The world goes white.

And when I open my eyes, I’m not on the 21st floor. I’m in the sky.

But the building—it’s still there.

It’s waving at me now.

The skyscraper. The one I just fell from.

And it’s not swaying anymore. It’s standing up, creaking and groaning, its windows wide open like bloodshot eyes.

“Clara?”

A voice. My own. But it’s not my voice. Not completely.

The city is gone. Just the building now. And the 21st floor window—shattered, but not for long.

Because outside, something is moving.

And it’s not happy.

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, so I need to write a science fiction story titled "The Last Transmission" that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit. The main character is the last surviving crew member trying to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The themes are isolation, sacrifice, and human connection. Also, if appropriate, include cursing to add emotional depth.

First, I should set up the setting. The cockpit is a confined space, which emphasizes isolation. Maybe the ship is damaged, systems failing. The crew member is alone, which highlights sacrifice—perhaps others didn't make it. The urgency of sending a message before power dies adds tension.

I need to create a protagonist. Let's name them something relatable, maybe Captain Jara Venn. She's the last one alive. Maybe she's been through a disaster, like a hull breach or system failure. The story should show her struggle against time and despair.

Themes: isolation—she's alone, no one to talk to. Sacrifice—maybe she had to leave others behind, or made a sacrifice to keep the ship running. Human connection—her message is to Earth, trying to preserve humanity's connection. Cursing could come out when she's frustrated or desperate.

Structure: Start with her in the cockpit, systems failing. She's trying to send the message. Maybe she has a log or a recording device. Flashbacks or memories of the crew? Or maybe she's talking to herself, venting her frustration.

Conflict: The ship's power is failing, so she has to prioritize sending the message. Maybe there's a countdown timer. She might have to make sacrifices, like using limited power for the transmission instead of life support. That could tie into sacrifice.

Emotional beats: Her desperation, the weight of isolation, the importance of the message. Maybe she remembers the crew, or Earth, and her determination to keep humanity connected.

Include some curses when things go wrong. For example, if a system fails, she might curse at the malfunction. Maybe she talks to herself, expressing her emotions.

Ending: She manages to send the message, but the ship is dying. Sacrifice—maybe she doesn't survive, but her message lives on. Or she sacrifices her own life to ensure the transmission works.

Check for word count: 800-1000 words. Need to be concise but impactful.

Possible plot points:

- Start with the cockpit environment: dim lights, alarms, malfunctioning systems.
- She's trying to send a message, but power is low. Maybe she's repairing something, or fighting against system failures.
- Flashbacks to the crew's demise—maybe an explosion, or a hull breach that killed others.
- Her internal monologue about the weight of responsibility, isolation, and the importance of the message.
- Technical challenges: maybe a power conduit is failing, she has to jury rig it. She curses when it doesn't work.
- The final transmission—she manages to send it, but the ship dies. She reflects on her sacrifice and the connection to Earth.

Make sure to include emotional elements, maybe her last thoughts about humanity, or a personal loss.

Avoid dialogue with others since it's only her. Use internal thoughts and curses to show her emotions.

Check for consistency in the setting—cockpit details, maybe a control panel, HUD, alarms, etc.

Need to build tension: time is running out, each system failure is a step closer to end. Maybe a countdown timer in the background.

Include specific details to make it vivid: the flickering lights, the hum of dying systems, the coldness of space, her physical state (maybe exhausted, injured?).

Maybe she's trying to send a message that contains the last data of the mission, or a final farewell. The message's content could touch on themes of sacrifice and connection.

Avoid clichés, make the emotions genuine. Maybe her curses are raw and real, showing her frustration and desperation.

Make sure the story has a beginning, middle, end. Start with her in the cockpit, struggling, then the climax of sending the message, and the resolution where she accepts her fate but ensures the message is sent.

Check for theme integration: isolation is shown through her solitude, sacrifice through her efforts to send the message despite the odds, human connection through the act of transmitting to Earth.

Potential title: "The Last Transmission" as given. Maybe include a log entry or a final message that's the transmission.

Alright, time to structure the story with these elements.

The cockpit was a tomb of steel and static. The lights flickered like a dying heartbeat—pulsing red, then dimming to a sickly amber before sputtering out entirely. Captain Jara Venn’s gloved hand slammed the control panel, the sound echoing in the hollow silence of the Odyssey’s bridge. She had no crew. No comms. No hope. Only the cold, relentless hum of systems failing around her.

“Come on,” she snarled, her voice raw with exhaustion. “You’re not dying on me now. Not after everything.”

The ship had been breached during a rogue meteor storm—three of her crew killed in an instant, the rest frozen in cryo pods that never woke. She’d been the only one still conscious when the emergency protocols failed. Now, the Odyssey was drifting through the void, its engines dead, life support on fumes. The only thing keeping her alive was the last transmission array, a relic of Earth’s last hope.

Jara’s suit was torn, a gash across her arm from the hull breach. Blood had dried into a rusted stain, but it didn’t matter. She’d patched the breach, sealed the airlock, and rerouted power to the comms array—her last act of defiance. The message wasn’t just data; it was a final breath of humanity. A log of everything they’d discovered on Epsilon-7, the dying planet that had promised new life. A farewell. A warning.

“Earth… Earth, if you’re listening…” she rasped into the comms mic, her voice cracking under the weight of static. “This is Captain Jara Venn. The Odyssey is down. We didn’t make it. But we found something. Something worth saving. If you can receive this… please—”

A system alarm blared. The power core’s readings dropped again. She slammed her fist against the console, a curse tearing from her throat. “You son of a bitch!” she spat. “You’re not shutting down! Not yet!”

The ship shuddered. A crack in the hull—another breach, maybe from the meteor storm. She had no time to fix it. The oxygen levels were dropping, and the comms array’s battery was dying. She’d rerouted every last joule of power to this transmission, but it wasn’t enough.

“Come on,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Just a few more seconds. Just… just—”

Her fingers danced across the interface, rerouting power from the life support system. The oxygen recycler sputtered and died. She felt the air thinning around her, the cold seeping into her lungs. But she didn’t stop. She couldn’t.

The message was a tapestry of memories—of the crew’s laughter, their sacrifices, the way they’d once looked at Earth from the viewport, imagining the children they’d never meet. She had to send it all. If the ship’s systems failed, the data would be lost. The last human voice from the edge of the galaxy would vanish.

“Earth,” she said again, her voice hoarse now. “If this reaches you… tell them we tried. Tell them we gave everything. Tell them we didn’t die alone.”

A warning flare went off in the corner of her HUD—core temperature rising. The ship was dying. She felt it in her bones. The cold wasn’t just from space; it was from the silence. The absence of voices. The absence of lives.

She thought of the captain who died saving her, of the engineer who sealed the breach with his own blood, of the navigator who froze mid-translation. They were gone. But their sacrifice had kept her alive this long. She wouldn’t let it end in nothingness.

“Transmission… initiating,” she said, voice steady now. “Data stream: Epsilon-7 anomalies. Core readings. Logs. Everything.”

The comms array flickered. A final burst of static. Then silence.

And then—her voice, raw and trembling—“This is Captain Jara Venn. If Earth receives this… know that we were here. We fought. We failed. But we mattered. We mattered.”

She didn’t know if the signal would reach Earth. She didn’t know if anyone on Earth was listening. But she had to try. Sacrifice wasn’t just about dying—it was about giving something back, even when you had nothing left.

The ship’s systems gave one last shudder. The lights died. The airlock sealed. And in the final silence, Jara’s voice echoed through the void, a whisper of humanity against the blackness.

And then she exhaled, her body failing, but her message alive.

“Earth,” she breathed. “If you’re out there… I’m sorry. I’m here. I’m with you.”

And the ship, and the crew, and the last hope of humanity—were all gone. But the transmission lived.

Using the following "story idea" below, write the first scene a horror novel introducing the young woman. This scene should start in the middle of the action, include dialog, vivid passages, and end on a cliffhanger relevant to the story idea but it should also be unexpected. The scene should be 1000 words long and escalate in conflict and suspense and be written in first person, present tense with the point of view character being the young woman. The pov character will CURSE AND SWEAR, and generally have a "filthy" mouth.

Story idea:
In a world ruled by dictatorship, a rebel young woman leads a rebellion against the system. Despite the risks, she fights to overthrow the dictator and restore democracy to her country. The government executes her for treason, but she sticks to her beliefs and is responsible for starting the revolution.

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, I need to write the first scene of a horror novel based on the given story idea. The user wants it to start in the middle of the action, include dialogue, vivid descriptions, and end on an unexpected cliffhanger. The POV is a young woman rebel leader who curses and has a "filthy" mouth. It should be first person present tense, 1000 words, escalating conflict and suspense.

First, starting in the middle of action. Maybe she's in the middle of a fight or a tense situation. Since it's horror, maybe something more psychological or supernatural? Wait, the story idea mentions a dictatorship, so maybe a more realistic rebellion scenario but with horror elements. The government executes her, but she's the one who started the revolution. So perhaps the scene is during an escape or a confrontation.

She needs to curse and swear, so her dialogue should reflect that. The setting: maybe a dark, oppressive environment. Maybe a chase scene? Or a confrontation with the regime. Let me think of a scenario where she's being pursued, but there's a twist. Maybe she's in a place that's supposed to be safe but something goes wrong.

Vivid descriptions: cold, damp, maybe a basement or a hidden location. The horror could be both external (government forces) and internal (her own paranoia or a supernatural element). But the story idea says it's a dictatorship, so maybe more about the regime's horror rather than supernatural. However, the user specified horror, so maybe adding some eerie elements.

Cliffhanger ending: Maybe she thinks she's safe, but then something unexpected happens. Like the person she's with betrays her, or there's a hidden threat. Or perhaps she's captured but there's a twist—maybe she's not really dead, or there's a twist on her execution.

Let me outline:

- Start with her in a tense situation. Maybe hiding, being chased. She's injured, determined. Dialogue with an ally. Then the ally betrays her, or something worse happens. Maybe she's in a safehouse, but the walls are closing in, or there's a monster? Wait, the story idea says the government executes her, but the scene is before that. So maybe the climax of her escape, leading to her capture. But the cliffhanger needs to be unexpected. Maybe she's captured, but then something happens—like the regime's horror element, like a supernatural twist, or a betrayal where she's not actually captured but in a trap.
- Alternatively, during the escape, she's cornered, and the enemy is closing in. She has a moment of resolve, but then something unexpected—maybe her own side betrays her, or a twist on her beliefs. Or maybe the horror element is that the regime uses some kind of mind control or horror elements.
- Wait, the user wants horror elements. So maybe the regime isn't just oppressive but has some supernatural horror aspects. Maybe the rebels are fighting not just the regime but also some otherworldly horror. But the story idea says it's a dictatorship, so maybe the horror comes from the regime's methods—torture, fear, psychological terror.
- But to make it a horror novel, perhaps the setting is a place that's haunted or has a cursed element. Maybe the rebellion is against both the regime and some ancient evil. But the story idea doesn't mention that. Hmm. The user might want a more realistic horror, but with the rebellion aspect.
- Alternatively, the horror could be the protagonist's descent into madness due to the oppression. But the user wants a cliffhanger relevant to the story idea. So maybe she's about to be captured, but then the twist is that she's not actually caught—maybe she's in a trap that's a metaphorical or literal hell.

Let me try to structure:

Start with her in a dangerous situation. Maybe hiding in a basement, trying to contact someone. She's injured, paranoid. Dialogue with an ally. Then the ally betrays her, or the regime catches up. But the cliffhanger could be that when she's captured, she realizes the regime has some horror element—maybe the execution is not what it seems, or she's being taken to a place where something worse awaits.

But need to make sure it's 1000 words. Let me think of the elements:

- First person POV, present tense.
- Her name: Maybe call her "Kaela" for the example.
- Setting: A crumbling safehouse, maybe in a city under regime control. The air is thick with fear. She's been shot, limping, hiding.
- Dialogue: With a comrade, maybe someone she doesn't trust fully. Tension in their conversation.
- Escalating conflict: Regime forces closing in, her injuries worsening, maybe a betrayal.
- Cliffhanger: Maybe the comrade betrays her, or she's about to be caught but something worse happens—like the regime has a horror element (e.g., the execution is a ritual, or she's being taken to a place where her mind will be broken, or she's not actually dying but being transformed into something else).

Let me draft the scene:

Start with her in a dark basement, bleeding, hiding. She's talking to someone via radio or a comrade. Tension builds as they hear approaching footsteps. She's determined but scared. Then the comrade says something that makes her suspicious. Maybe he's a double agent. Then the regime soldiers break in, but instead of just capturing her, there's a horror element—maybe the soldiers are not human, or there's a ritual happening.

But the user said the government executes her, so maybe the cliffhanger is that she's about to be executed, but then something happens—like she's not dead, or the execution is a setup for something worse.

Alternatively, during the escape, she's cornered, and the last line is her realizing that the regime has a horror element she didn't expect. Maybe the person who was supposed to help her is actually part of the regime, and as she's about to be captured, she hears a voice that's not human, or something else.

Let me try to outline:

- Kaela is hiding in a basement, injured, waiting for extraction. She's talking to someone named Jax via comms. Tension because they're late. She's paranoid, swearing, frustrated.
- Then, the sound of boots, and Jax says he's here. But when she opens the door, it's not Jax but regime soldiers. She tries to fight, but they're too many. She's about to be captured, but then something happens—maybe the soldiers are not real, or there's a twist where she's being taken to a place where her mind is going to be broken, or she's being used in some ritual.

But the cliffhanger needs to be unexpected. Maybe when she's captured, she realizes that the regime has a horror element—like they're using her as a sacrifice for some ancient evil, or she's being taken to a place where she'll become part of the regime's horror.

Alternatively, during the fight, she's about to die, but then she wakes up in a different reality, realizing the horror is not just the regime but something more.

But the story idea says she's executed, so maybe the cliffhanger is that she's captured, and as they're taking her, she hears a voice saying "You're exactly what we need," implying she's part of some horror ritual.

Alternatively, she's about to be executed, but the execution is a horror show—maybe the dictator is a monster, or the method of execution is grotesque.

But the user wants the cliffhanger relevant to the story idea. The story idea says she's responsible for starting the revolution. So maybe the cliffhanger is that even as she's captured, she knows her actions will inspire others, but the horror twist is that the regime has a way to erase her existence, or she's being transformed into something else.

Alternatively, during the capture, she realizes that the regime's horror is not just oppression but a living nightmare—maybe the soldiers are not human, or the place she's taken is a prison with supernatural elements.

I need to make sure the dialogue is filled with curses, and the setting is vivid. Let me start drafting:

Start with her in the basement, cold, damp. She's bleeding, maybe from a gunshot wound. She's talking to Jax, who's supposed to extract her but is late. She's frustrated, swearing. Then she hears footsteps, and Jax arrives, but something's wrong. Maybe he's injured, or there's a twist. Then the regime soldiers break in. She fights, but they're too many. Then as she's captured, she hears a voice that says something ominous, like "You'll be our martyr, but we'll make you scream louder than any of them."

But need to make it 1000 words. Let me check the elements:

- Start in middle of action: Yes, she's hiding, injured.
- Dialogue: With Jax, maybe.
- Suspense and conflict: Regime closing in, her injuries, betrayal.
- Cliffhanger: Maybe the regime's horror element is revealed when she's captured.

Make sure her dialogue is full of curses. Use vivid descriptions of the setting, her pain, the tension.

Avoid clichés, make the horror elements unique. Maybe the regime uses psychological horror, or the basement is a trap with some supernatural aspect.

Okay, time to write the scene with these elements.

OUTPUT:

<P></P>

The basement reeks of mildew and blood. I’m crouched in the corner, my side screaming like a feral cat with a broken spine. The bullet wound from last night’s raid is throbbing, and I’m pretty sure it’s not just the pain—something’s wrong. The air here feels thick, like it’s been stewing in a septic tank for weeks. I should’ve left this hole hours ago, but the comms crackled with static, and Jax swore he’d be here by dawn. Now? Dawn’s bleeding through the cracks in the ceiling, and I’m still stuck in this godforsaken crawl space, praying the regime’s boots don’t stomp through the floorboards like a goddamn war drum.

“Jax!” I snarl, slapping the rusted radio on the concrete. “You better not be jerking me around, you fucking traitor—”

Static. Just static. My knuckles whiten around the device as I slam it against the wall. “You think I’m gonna die in this moldy hole while you’re out sucking some regime general’s cock for a promotion?” I spit, my voice raw. “I’ll gut you myself if you’re not here in ten minutes.”

The sound of boots. Not the regime’s—those are too loud, too methodical. These? They’re soft. Too soft. Like someone’s tiptoeing through a minefield. My hand flies to the knife hidden in my boot. I’ve seen what happens when you let your guard down. The last guy who trusted the wrong face? They found him strangled with his own entrails, hanging from the ceiling of this very basement.

“Kaela,” a voice rasps from the radio. It’s not Jax. It’s not even a voice I recognize. “You should’ve stayed in your hole.”

I freeze. The radio dies. The floorboards creak above me. I hear it—footsteps, slow and deliberate, like a predator pacing its cage. My pulse is a jackhammer now. I’m bleeding, I’m tired, and I’m not gonna let some backroom scum finish me off.

“Show yourself!” I bellow, my voice cracking. “I’ll carve your fucking eyes out if you—”

The door slams open.

I don’t have time to react. The light from the hallway blinds me, and when my vision clears, there’s no one there. Just a flickering bulb overhead, casting jagged shadows that twist like serpents. My knife’s in my hand, but I’m not sure if it’s for the intruder or myself.

“Hello?” I call, my voice shaking. “This isn’t funny, you—”

A laugh. Low. Wet. Like a knife dragged across glass.

I spin, knife raised. Empty room. But the air is colder now. The walls seem to lean in. My breath catches. This place—it’s not just old. It’s alive.

“Jax?” I try again, my voice fraying at the edges. “You there? You better not be—”

A thud. A gasp.

I freeze. The sound came from the hallway.

“Jax?” I whisper.

No answer. Just the drip of water, the creak of rotting wood, and the sound of my own heartbeat, loud enough to shake the walls.

I creep toward the door, knife trembling in my grip. The hallway is a black maw, and something about it feels… wrong. The air smells like burnt hair and rust. I step out, and the light from the bulb behind me dies with a pop.

Darkness.

Then—

A hand slams into my shoulder. I spin, knife flashing, but it’s not a person. It’s a shadow. Or something that wants to be.

It lunges. I duck, but the blade meets flesh. A gurgling scream. The thing recoils, and in the dim glow of the flickering bulb, I see it: a mannequin, its face melted into a snarl, one eye dangling by a thread.

“Not real,” I mutter, but my voice is a whisper now. “Not real—”

Another thud. The door slams shut behind me.

I’m trapped.

The basement door creaks open again. This time, it’s not the regime. It’s her.

The woman in the black coat. I’ve seen her in the propaganda reels—smiling, serene, like a saint. But now she’s here, in the flesh, and her eyes are two black holes.

“Kaela,” she says, voice honeyed and sharp. “You always did have a filthy mouth.”

I want to curse her, but my throat is dry. She steps closer, and the air grows thick, cloying. The walls seem to pulse now, like a heart.

“You think you’re fighting for freedom?” she asks, tilting her head. “You’re just a spark in their fire. A spark that’s about to die.”

“Go to hell,” I snarl, but the words taste like ash.

She smiles. “Oh, I’m already there.”

The floorboards groan. The shadows writhe. I see it now—her coat isn’t fabric. It’s skin. Real skin, peeling at the seams.

“Why are you here?” I demand.

“To end this,” she says, and the room seems to shudder. “You’re the key. The martyr. The spark. But you’re not you anymore, are you? You’re just a ghost in their head.”

I lunge, knife raised, but her hand slams into my chest like a freight train. I fly backward, hitting the wall with a sickening crack. The pain is nothing compared to the horror in her eyes—no, not horror. Satisfaction.

“You’ll scream for them,” she whispers, leaning down. “Loud enough to wake the dead.”

I try to move, but my legs won’t work. The shadows wrap around me, cold and hungry. I see her mouth open, and out of it spills a sound—not words, not a language, but something older. Something that makes the walls bleed.

And then—

A gunshot.

The woman’s head explodes in a geyser of black sludge.

I gasp. The sound echoes, and from the hallway, a figure steps forward.

Jax.

But his face is not Jax’s. It’s my own.

“Kaela,” he says, voice trembling. “I’m sorry.”

He raises a gun.

And I realize—

The regime didn’t send soldiers. They sent me.

The horror isn’t in the regime. It’s in me.

And I’m not sure if I’m the victim… or the monster.
