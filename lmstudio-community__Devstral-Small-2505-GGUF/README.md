**Model creator:** [mistralai](https://huggingface.co/mistralai)<br>
**Original model**: [Devstral-Small-2505](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505)<br>
**GGUF quantization:** provided by [mattjcly](https://huggingface.co/mattjcly) based on `llama.cpp` release [b5426](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b5426)<br>

## Technical Details

Supports a context length of 131072 tokens.

From [mistralai README.md](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505/blob/38b103a974acdb8861cc8cce6c60f5a477c6abe5/README.md):

"Devstral excels at using tools to explore codebases, editing multiple files and power software engineering agents. The model debuts as the #1 open source model on SWE-bench.

Despite its compact size of just 24 billion parameters, Devstral outperforms much larger models in agentic coding tasks. These tasks require exploring a codebase and making complex modifications to resolve issues."

## Special thanks

üôè Special thanks to [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and the whole team working on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/) for making all of this possible.
