# QuantFactory/llama-3.1-medprm-reward-v1.0-GGUF
This is quantized version of [dmis-lab/llama-3.1-medprm-reward-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/dmis-lab/llama-3.1-medprm-reward-v1.0) created using llama.cpp

# Original Model Card


# Med-PRM-Reward (Version 1.0)
üöÄ Med-PRM-Reward is among the first Process Reward Models (PRMs) specifically designed for the medical domain. Unlike conventional PRMs, it enhances its verification capabilities by integrating clinical knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Med-PRM-Reward demonstrates exceptional performance in scaling-test-time computation, particularly outperforming majority‚Äêvoting ensembles on complex medical reasoning tasks. Moreover, its scalability is not limited to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct: it delivers similarly outstanding results in scaling-test-time computation across multiple other medical‚Äêspecialized models. Notably, when combined with llama-3-meerkat-8b-v1.0, it became the first 8B model framework to surpass a score of 80 on the MedQA (4-option) benchmark.

docs = ["Document 1: Causes of Posterior Urethral Valves.  The valves can block the outflow of urine through the urethra, leading to damage in the bladder, ureters and kidneys. However, it is important to note that PUV occurs randomly by chance and is not caused by anything a mother did or did not do during pregnancy.In the womb, if the baby is unable to urinate due to PUV, there might be a deficiency in amniotic fluid, known as oligohydramnios. A major concern for oligohydramnios is the lack of proper lung development, called lung hypoplasia",

## Evaluation
Across seven medical benchmarks, we conducted scaling‚Äêtest‚Äêtime computation using solutions generated by the Med-PRM-policy model, evaluating 64 solutions per question.
