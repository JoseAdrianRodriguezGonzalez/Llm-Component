**GGUF quantization:** provided by [bartowski](https://huggingface.co/bartowski) based on `llama.cpp` release [b5697](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b5697)<br>

## Technical Details

Supports a context length of 32k tokens

Skywork-SWE-32B is a code agent model developed by [Skywork AI](https://skywork.ai/home), specifically designed for software engineering (SWE) tasks

Skywork-SWE-32B attains 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.swebench.com) benchmark, outperforming previous open-source SoTA [Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B) LLMs built on the [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) agent framework

When incorporated with test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SoTA results for sub-32B parameter models

## Special thanks

üôè Special thanks to [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and the whole team working on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/) for making all of this possible.
