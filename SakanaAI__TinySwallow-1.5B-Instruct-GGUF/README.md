# TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF

ü§ó [Models](https://huggingface.co/SakanaAI) | üìö [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16937) | üìù [Blog](https://sakana.ai/taid-jp/) | üê¶ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SakanaAILabs)

This is the [TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/SakanaAI/TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct) model in GGUF format. 

[TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/SakanaAI/TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct) is an instruction-tuned version of [TinySwallow-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/SakanaAI/TinySwallow-1.5B), created through *TAID (Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation)*, our new knowledge distillation method. 
We used [Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) as the teacher model and [Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) as the student model. 
The model has been further instruction-tuned to enhance its ability to follow instructions and engage in conversations in Japanese.
